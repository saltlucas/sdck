		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Coalition of community groups encouraged support of $3.28-million contract</p> <p>{readmorelink}Read the full article...{/readmorelink}</p> <p>  <!--more-->  <br /><br />SAN DIEGO, CA –The San Diego City Council approved this week a $3.28-million contract for public outreach and program management to allow important community engagement and education on recycled wastewater for potable use. The public awareness campaign will seek to help residents understand the indirect potable reuse (IPR) pilot project currently underway in the City of San Diego. The two-year project, which is fully funded, will demonstrate whether highly treated wastewater can augment local reservoirs.<br /><br />To encourage council members to vote in favor of the contract, Coastkeeper helped bring together the IPR Coalition, an unprecedented alliance of San Diego groups including San Diego County Taxpayers Association, San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce, San Diego and Imperial Counties Labor Council, BIOCOMM and other business, labor, economic growth and ratepayer advocates. The organizations aligned to highlight the importance of investing in local sources of drought-proof water supplies that will require less reliance on energy and increasingly expensive imported water.<br /><br />“San Diego currently imports nearly 80 percent of its water from outside the region. Our overreliance on these sources has tremendous environmental and economic impacts on our region,” said Coastkeeper Executive Director Bruce Reznik. “Recycling wastewater into drinking water is a reliable, cost-effective and environmentally friendly way to enhance our local water supplies.”<br /><br />The demonstration project resulted from the City’s 2005 Water Reuse Study, which explored various options to maximize reuse at the City’s existing North City reclamation facility. If the demonstration project is successful, a full-scale project could ultimately provide up to 16 million gallons per day of advanced treated water from the North City plant to augment San Vincente Reservoir, a local source for drinking water.<br /><br />The approved outreach campaign will help residents understand that IPR not only reduces the nearly 200 million gallons per day of wastewater that is currently dumped into the ocean, but will also be less expensive than current transfer methods and alternatives like desalination. Compared to conventional water treatment methods, IPR undergoes more stringent review and monitoring by the California Department of Health Services and other regulatory agencies. And due to the nature of the processing, it will be cleaner and safer than any water that is currently imported to our region.<br /><br />For more information on IPR and San Diego’s water supply, visit Coastkeeper’s website at localhost/sdcoastkeeper.</p> <div style="text-align: center;"># # #</div> <p><br />Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects the region’s bays, beaches, watersheds and ocean for the people and wildlife that depend on them. We balance community outreach, education, and advocacy to promote stewardship of clean water and a healthy coastal ecosystem.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>February 10 - Coastal Commission Agrees Poseidon Intentionally Omitted Information</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Commission votes 8-4 to deny environmentalists’ request to revoke desal plant permit</p> <p>{readmorelink}Read the full article...{/readmorelink}</p> <p>  <!--more-->  <br />OCEANSIDE, Calif. – February 10, 2010 – The California Coastal Commission and its staff acknowledged today that Poseidon Resources intentionally withheld information that resulted inerroneous greenhouse gas mitigation calculations for its planned Carlsbad Desalination Plant (CDP). Ultimately, the Commission voted 8 – 4 to deny a request from San Diego Coastkeeper, Surfrider Foundation and the Coastal Environmental Rights Foundation to revoke the plant’s permit, and it also voted to deny Poseidon’s request to change findings that it intentionally omitted pertinent information while supplying inaccurate data.<br /><br />“This is what we’ve been saying since the beginning—Poseidon misrepresented material facts to the Commission and the public regarding the project—and the Coastal Commission agrees with us,” said Executive Coastkeeper Bruce Reznik. “This is not the project we were promised.”<br /><br />The original approval of the CDP in 2007 required Poseidon to offset the greenhouse gas emissions attributable to its energy use. Poseidon argued that the water it produced would replace supplies imported from the Sacramento Delta—one of San Diego’s main sources of water. However, the Coastal Commission and its staff acknowledged today that Poseidon withheld a 2005 draft contract for a Metropolitan Water District subsidy, which clearly  established the CDP would not replace water pumped in from the Delta. <br /><br />At the time of the Coastal Commission approval, Poseidon representative Peter MacLaggan testified that “…the project will produce 56,000-acre feet per year of desalinated water that will directly replace on a 1:1 basis water that otherwise would be imported to Poseidon's customers from the State Water Project.”<br /><br />“Because Poseidon undermined the public process and concealed important information, the community and environment will suffer more from the Carlsbad Desalination Plant,” said Reznik. “The project will only offset one-third of the 100,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide that will be contributed by the facility, but it should be responsible for all of it.”<br /><br />The legal standard for a revocation process necessitates agreement on three parts: that Poseidon: (1) provided inaccurate, erroneous, or incomplete information ; (2) that it did so intentionally; and (3) that inclusion of the accurate/complete information would have caused a different conclusion. While the Commission and its staff agreed Poseidon intentionally withheld important information and included inaccuracies in their reports, the Commission found it would have approved the permit based on information provided to them from other sources.<br /><br />Because this is a precedent-setting process for desalination plants planned along the California coastline and throughout the nation, Coastkeeper and other environmental groups have insisted that it follow regulatory processes to ensure the facility is as protective of the coastal environment as possible.<br /><br />San Diego Coastkeeper has promoted a water supply hierarchy in order to avoid just the sort of impacts caused by this project. Coastkeeper routinely advocates for conservation and smart land use practices to be considered first, followed by water recycling and reuse, and lastly responsible, environmentally friendly desalination if needed. More voices have joined this call for a water ‘loading order’. Lieutenant Governor John Garamendi, a State Lands Commissioner who had voted to approve<br />the Poseidon project at that agency, has since expressed concerns with moving forward with desalination before first implementing more environmentally friendly water supply options.<br /><br /></p> <div style="text-align: center;"># # #</div> <p><br />Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects the region’s bays, beaches, watersheds and ocean for the people and wildlife that depend on them. We balance community outreach, education, and advocacy to promote stewardship of clean water and a healthy coastal ecosystem.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Clifton formerly directed San Diego County’s Ocean Recreational Water Program</p> <p>{readmorelink}Read the full article...{/readmorelink}</p> <p>  <!--more-->  <br />SAN DIEGO, March 3, 2010 –San Diego Coastkeeper, San Diego’s largest professional<br />environmental organization, announced today that Clay Clifton has joined its staff as the Watershed<br />Monitoring Program Manager. Clifton brings to Coastkeeper more than ten years of experience in<br />monitoring contamination events at 52 miles of public beaches, most recently directing the Ocean<br />Recreational Water Program for the County of San Diego, Department of Environmental Health.<br /><br />“Clay ran San Diego County’s award-winning beach water quality monitoring program for a<br />decade; his name is synonymous with water monitoring in this region,” said Bruce Reznik, executive<br />director for San Diego Coastkeeper. “Clay’s leadership and expertise perfectly complements our<br />volunteer watershed monitoring program, which is the largest in the state.”<br /><br />Clifton will run Coastkeeper’s watershed monitoring program, which conducts monthly<br />sampling events in nine out of 11 county watersheds, encompassing waters that no other organization<br />currently monitors. A team of trained citizen volunteers collects the data, which is backed by state<br />approved quality control standards, and then Coastkeeper uses it to help improve government decision<br />making regarding the local water bodies.<br /><br />While in his previous role with the county, Clifton worked alongside Scripps Institute of<br />Oceanography to pilot the San Diego Coastal Ocean Observing System, which was the first system<br />designed for real time water quality monitoring. He also prepped the county to implement the stateinitiated<br />AB411, which required the county to increase its sampling efforts and database management<br />from 30 samples a month to more than 200 a month.<br /><br />The San Diego County chapter of the Surfrider Foundation also voted Clifton as “Waterman of<br />the Year, 2005” for his professional accomplishments in support of clean water goals.<br />Clifton has a master’s degree in marine affairs and policy from University of Miami, Rosenstiel<br />School of Marine &amp; Atmospheric Science, and a bachelor’s degree in political science from Furman<br />University.<br /><br /></p> <div style="text-align: center;"># # #</div> <p><br />Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects the region’s bays, beaches, watersheds<br />and ocean for the people and wildlife that depend on them.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Improvements directly link to lawsuit in 2000 that required investment in infrastructure</p> <p>{readmorelink}Read the full article...{/readmorelink}</p>  <!--more-->  <p>San Diego – February 24, 2010 – San Diego Coastkeeper joins Mayor Jerry Sanders in acknowledging the ten-fold drop in the number of sewer spills in the City of San Diego since 2000. The<br />decrease demonstrates the success of a lawsuit in 2000 between San Diego Coastkeeper, Surfrider Foundation and the U.S. EPA and the City of San Diego that ultimately required the City to invest over $1 billion in its sewage collection system through 2013.<br /><br />“It is encouraging that the City’s sewage spill rate has dropped so dramatically as a result of the lawsuit we initiated in 2000, which we settled in 2007,” Coastkeeper’s Executive Director Bruce Reznik said. “Because the settlement required the City to rehabilitate 250 miles of pipeline, implement a pipecleaning program and reduce spills caused by cooking oil and grease, it is no surprise to us that City<br />Wastewater officials credited those factors to the success.” <br /><br />The reduction in number of spills is certainly a laudable achievement; however, the City must remain on guard against spills.<br /><br />“This means while spills may happen less often, we still suffer from incidents such as the 2007 Lake Hodges pipe breakage that allowed 400,000 gallons of raw sewage to dump into the reservoir over<br />five days,” said Reznik. “The City must continue with the same diligence and focus to further reduce both the frequency and volume of sewage spills in San Diego.”<br /><br />According to Coastkeeper scientists, this continued effort is especially important to maintain.<br />Like the rest of California, the San Diego region has experienced droughts during the past three years.<br />Several years of less than normal rainfall contributed to reduction of sewage spills. However, the city<br />will not be able to rely on nature to keep the spill rate down.<br /><br />“As our region moves into wetter periods, stormwater can infiltrate sewage systems stressing<br />demand and causing breakage,” said Coastkeeper Staff Scientist Jen Kovecses. “Keeping pipes clear and<br />replacing old ones is essential in preparing the sewage infrastructure to withstand amounts<br />experienced during the rainy seasons.”<br /><br />Sewage spills, which contain an array of bacteria, viruses and parasites, pose a serious public<br />health threat. While it is difficult to get data on how many people get sick from swimming in sewage<br />contaminated waters, experts say it could be as high as seven million beachgoers every year. The<br />elderly, children, and people with compromised immune systems are the most susceptible to illness. By<br />bringing large quantities of nutrients, which feed algal growth and cause dwindling oxygen levels that<br />can cause massive fish kills, sewage spills also pose a significant environmental threat.<br /><br /></p> <div style="text-align: center;"># # #</div> <p><br />Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects the region’s bays, beaches, watersheds<br />and ocean for the people and wildlife that depend on them.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>San Diego beach cleanup data supports need for state bill AB 1998</p> <p>{readmorelink}Read the full article...{/readmorelink}</p>  <!--more-->  <p>San Diego—Tuesday, June 1, 2010—San Diego Coastkeeper joins Environment California in encouraging the State Assembly to pass AB 1998 (Brownley), a bill that would ban single-use plastic bags in California.  The Assembly is expected to vote on the bill by June 4 – if passed, it would make California the first state in the country to prohibit grocery stores and pharmacies from giving away free, single-use plastic bags. According to inland and beach cleanup data collected by San Diego Coastkeeper and its environmental partners, plastic bags remain of the top ten items polluting San Diego County. <br /><br />“Beach cleanups are helpful in keeping trash away from the sea and showing the public how much trash is spread along our waterways, but cleanups are a reactive solution to this ocean pollution challenge,” said Alicia Glassco, San Diego Coastkeeper Marine Debris Coordinator. “We need to address single-use plastic waste at the sources, and AB 1998 will bring California to the forefront of marine debris prevention.”<br /><br />Bill AB 1998 would ban the free giveaway of single-use plastic bags at grocery stores, pharmacies and convenience stores. It would allow the use of paper bags made of at least 40 percent post consumer paper, and the cost of the bag would be charged to the customer.  Bill supporters expect this move to encourage shoppers to bring their own reusable bag. <br /><br />A recent report by the Ocean Conservancy, which analyzed the amount and types of trash picked up on beaches worldwide during the annual International Coastal Cleanup Day, found that plastic bags and food packaging remained in the top four most found items. On a single day, 143,556 food containers and 71,336 plastic bags were picked up along the California coastline. <br /><br />Locally, through twice-monthly beach cleanups hosted by Coastkeeper and Surfrider Foundation, plastic bags dominate the top ten most common items removed from San Diego beaches. <br /><br />San Diego Coastkeeper wants citizens to take a stand against litter, especially single-use plastics that get loose from trash streams and don’t readily break down in the marine environment. <br /><br />“Residents should call their assembly member and senator and ask them to support this bill,” said Glassco. “What starts by volunteering at a cleanup and ends with a call to your elected official may make a radical difference in reducing the amount of plastic in our ocean.”<br /><br />Visit San Diego Coastkeeper online for a full schedule of beach cleanups, and click here to download Ocean Conservancy’s entire report.<br /><br />###<br /><br />San Diego Coastkeeper<br />Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects the region’s bays, beaches, watersheds and ocean for the people and wildlife that depend on them.  We balance community outreach, education, and advocacy to promote stewardship of clean water and a healthy coastal ecosystem.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lessons teach students about water quality, pollution prevention</p> <p>{readmorelink}Read the full article...{/readmorelink}</p>  <!--more-->  <p>SAN DIEGO, CA –San Diego Coastkeeper and The City of San Diego launched the Project SWELL Kindergarten curriculum in San Diego Unified School District (SDUSD) this morning at Ocean Beach Elementary School. City of San Diego Mayor Jerry Sanders, SDUSD Board of Education President Richard Barrera and San Diego Coastkeeper Executive Director Bruce Reznik joined Kindergarten teachers Molly Stewart and Jasmine Greene as they led students in a Project SWELL demonstration about different plants and animals living in San Diego’s aquatic environments and about storm drain pollution. <br /><br />Project SWELL (Stewardship: Water Education for Lifelong Leadership) promotes awareness of clean water and pollution prevention and fosters a sense of environmental stewardship in children. The City of San Diego and San Diego Coastkeeper have united with SDUSD to enhance the existing science curriculum with hands-on science lessons to teach students about pollution prevention in their local environment. This unique education program aligns with the State Science Content Standards and is adapted to teach students about issues in their community and promotes sustainable improvement by engaging children in improving the health of our water. <br /><br />“Project SWELL gives San Diego’s children the decision-making tools to become a part of the solution rather than the problem,“ said Reznik. ”Many business leaders support Project SWELL as its hands-on, active investigation enhances overall science learning, which is needed to support the growth of green-technology in the region.”<br /><br />This innovative approach to learning began with the inaugural rollout of the 5th-grade lessons in 2004. Since then, project partners have developed and implemented lessons for 2nd, 4th and 6th grades in SDUSD and 5th grade classrooms in Oceanside Unified School District. Since its inception, Project SWELL has reached 120,000 students. The lessons provide a tremendous benefit for a wide range of stakeholders throughout San Diego, including students, the City of San Diego and San Diego’s coastal environment. <br />With the roll out of the Kindergarten lessons, Project SWELL will reach more than 50,000 children annually. Ultimately, Coastkeeper plans to develop Project SWELL in all K-12 classrooms in SDUSD and continue to expand the program into other school district countywide. <br /><br />Project SWELL wouldn’t be possible without the generous support from Coastkeeper’s partners and sponsors: The Charles and Ruth Billingsley Foundation, California Coastal Commission - Whale Tail License Plate Grants Program, Hans &amp; Margaret Doe Charitable Trust, Hervey Family Non-endowment Fund at the San Diego Foundation, IKEA, San Diego, J.W. Sefton Foundation, McCarthy Family Foundation, Metropolitan Water District of Southern California,  New Belgium, Pacific Life Foundation, Price Charities, Qualcomm, REI, San Diego County Water Authority, San Diego Regional Airport Authority, Sempra Energy Foundation, State Water Resources Control Board, Supervisor Pam Slater-Price and the County of San Diego, The Hattie Ettinger Conservation Fund at The San Diego Foundation, The Heller Foundation of San Diego, The PIMCO Foundation, Think Blue, City of San Diego, Unified Port of San Diego, and Wells Fargo Foundation.<br /><br />For more information on Project SWELL, visit www.ProjectSWELL.org.<br /><br />#  #  #  <br /><br />Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects the region’s bays, beaches, watersheds and ocean for the people and wildlife that depend on them. We balance community outreach, education, and advocacy to promote stewardship of clean water and a healthy coastal ecosystem.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>May 5 - State Water Board Acts on Devastating Power Plant Cooling Systems</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Regional Board to decide fate of South Bay Power Plant on May 12</p> <p>{readmorelink}Read the full article...{/readmorelink}</p>  <!--more-->  <p>Sacramento, Calif.—May 5, 2010—The State Water Resources Control Board adopted a final state policy late Wednesday that will put California on a path to compliance with the Clean Water Act’s requirements for power plant cooling systems. Nineteen California coastal and Delta power plants use World-War II-era, “once-through cooling” (OTC) systems that pull in up to 16 billion gallons of coastal and Delta waters every year, killing marine life pulled into the plant and destroying many species caught on the plants’ screens. The Board’s new policy will require power plants to phase out the impacts of this devastating practice. <br /><br />“Almost 40 years after Congress called for an end to the impacts of these cooling systems, California has taken positive action to ensure that we enjoy a healthy environment and sustainable energy,” said Linda Sheehan, Executive Director for the California Coastkeeper Alliance. “The policy adopted by the State Water Board reflects five years of exhaustive independent studies, careful analysis and extensive debate among stakeholders, and we look forward to its prompt and full implementation.” <br /><br />These antiquated OTC systems kill tens of billions of fish, turtles, seals and other marine life each year in California alone. The 12 Southern California plants kill up to 30 percent of the number of fish recreationally caught off the Southern California coast each year, undermining state initiatives to protect marine life. The State Water Board adopted the final policy after a nine-hour hearing, marking the conclusion of five years of public process involving numerous state and federal regulatory agencies, power plant owners and operators, and a coalition of conservation, fishing and environmental justice groups. <br /><br />The policy sets a compliance schedule for each OTC plant, including the three plants in San Diego County.  The policy designates December 31, 2011, 2017, and 2022 as compliance dates for the South Bay Power Plant, Encina Power Station, and the San Onofre Nuclear Generation Station respectively. The Regional Water Board will be addressing the South Bay Power Plant at a hearing on May 12 to determine whether the plant should be shut down earlier.  The new policy will not impact the Regional Board’s May 12 decision.   <br /><br />The federal Clean Water Act (CWA) requires power plants to use the “Best Technology Available” to minimize OTC impacts. However, virtually all California power plants using OTC do so under long-expired CWA permits and fail to use modern cooling (or energy generating) technologies. With the release of the policy imminent, power plants have begun upgrading their operations to newer generation technologies and “closed cycle” cooling systems, which avoid OTC’s impacts to coastal ecosystems. <br /><br />“It is time to stop putting the costs of our energy generation on the backs of the ocean and Delta and the people that depend on healthy waterways,” says Sheehan. “The Board’s action will start to reverse that trend and lead the state to a sustainable future.” <br /><br />###<br /><br />San Diego Coastkeeper<br />Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper (localhost/sdcoastkeeper) protects the region’s bays, beaches, watersheds and ocean for the people and wildlife that depend on them.  We balance community outreach, education, and advocacy to promote stewardship of clean water and a healthy coastal ecosystem.<br /><br />California Coastkeeper Alliance<br />Using law, policy and science, the California Coastkeeper Alliance supports and enhances the work of California’s 12 Waterkeeper organizations and works to ensure that Californians enjoy clean water and a healthy coast. www.cacoastkeeper.org.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2010 schedule announced to organize volunteers to remove debris from coastline</p> <p>{readmorelink}Read the full article...{/readmorelink}</p>  <!--more-->  <p>SAN DIEGO, April 13, 2010- San Diego Coastkeeper and the Surfrider Foundation San Diego Chapter partner to bring San Diego County its 2010 beach cleanup schedule and a summary of data collected at 2009 events. Sponsored by Ford Motor Company Fund and Community Services, our twice-monthly beach cleanup program organizes volunteers to pick up trash from San Diego’s beaches. The cleanups aim to remove littered items that plague San Diego’s coastline before they wash into the ocean. <br />“Last year more than 6,600 people removed about 12,000 pounds of trash at cleanups across the county,” said Coastkeeper executive director Bruce Reznik. “That’s a massive amount of debris that would have most likely found its way into the Pacific.”<br /><br />When analyzed, data collection cards from the 2009 cleanups showed that:<br />•    Volunteers removed more than 109, 404 pieces of plastics, including 48,154 cigarette butts<br />•    Volunteers collected 12,126 pieces of Styrofoam<br />•    Styrofoam, cigarette butts and “other plastics” are the top three most common items found each year for the past three years<br />•    Interesting items found in 2009 included a finger skateboard, ice tray, love note and a faucet<br /><br />“During the monthly cleanups, 109,494 pieces of plastic and items made of plastic or Styrofoam were collected at 20 different locations countywide,” said Surfrider Foundation San Diego Chapter Coordinator Bill Hickman. “Plastics never biodegrade, so they have a lasting negative impact on our beaches and the health of the Pacific Ocean ecosystem.” <br />Many people improperly dispose of plastic items such as cigarette butts without realizing the harm they are doing to the environment; the number of butts collected on or near San Diego beaches increased by nearly 10,000 last year to a total of nearly 50,000.  <br /><br />The 2010 cleanups rotate locations to popular beaches throughout the county and are open to all volunteers willing to help pick up trash. Organizers expect anywhere from 100 to 500 people at each cleanup. They do supply bags, gloves and water for those who participate, but request that volunteers bring their own gardening gloves, buckets and reusable water bottles to help reduce trash created during the pickup.<br /><br />The year’s cleanup schedule also includes larger multi-beach cleanups such as Creek to Bay on April 24, the Morning After Mess on July 5 and Coastal Cleanup Day on September 25. When the results from cleanups organized by local non-profit organizations are combined, nearly 35,000 volunteers collected 680,000 pounds of trash from San Diego waterways and inland canyons. That’s 340 tons.<br /><br />The twice-monthly beach cleanups are on the following Saturdays:<br />Feb 13- South Carlsbad- Ponto Jetty<br />Feb 20- Encinitas- Moonlight Beach <br />Feb 27- Pacific Beach- Tourmaline<br />Mar 13- Oceanside Pier<br />Mar 27- Coronado City Beach<br />Apr 10- Sunset Cliffs<br />Apr 24- Creek to Bay Cleanup<br />May 8- Del Mar<br />May 15- Encinitas- Moonlight Beach<br />May 22- Mission Bay- Fiesta Island<br />Jun 12- Oceanside- Buccaneer Beach<br />Jun 26- Pacific Beach- Crystal Pier<br />Jul 6 (Tuesday)- Morning After Mess <br />Jul 24- South Mission Beach<br />Aug 7- Carlsbad- Tamarack<br />Aug 21- Pacific Beach Drive<br />Sept 4- La Jolla Shores<br />Sept 25- CA Coastal Cleanup Day<br />Oct 9- Torrey Pines State Beach<br />Oct 16- Encinitas- Moonlight Beach<br />Oct 23- Tijuana River Valley<br />Nov 13- Cardiff State Beach<br />Nov 27- Ocean Beach Jetty<br />Dec 11- Imperial Beach Pier <br /><br />For more information on San Diego beach cleanups, visit Coastkeeper’s website at localhost/sdcoastkeeper or Surfrider’s website at www.surfriderSD.org.<br /><br /># # #<br /><br />San Diego Coastkeeper<br />Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects the region’s bays, beaches, watersheds and ocean for the people and wildlife that depend on them.  We balance community outreach, education, and advocacy to promote stewardship of clean water and a healthy coastal ecosystem.<br /><br />Surfrider Foundation San Diego Chapter<br />The Surfrider Foundation is a non-profit grassroots organization dedicated to the protection and enjoyment of our world’s oceans, waves and beaches.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recent investigation, news coverage of desalination plants raise more uncertainties</p> <p>{readmorelink}Read the full article...{/readmorelink}</p>  <!--more-->  <p>SAN DIEGO, CA – The State Water Resources Control Board announced its decision to dismiss a petition from environmental groups San Diego Coastkeeper and the Surfrider Foundation to review a Regional Board permit for the Carlsbad Desalination Plant. This decision comes almost simultaneously with the same Board’s release of policy regarding the negative impacts of the antiquated once-through-cooling technology used in power plants, the same technology that will be used in the proposed Carlsbad Desalination Plant. <br /><br />“The State Water Board’s position on once-through-cooling technology is in direct conflict with its decision to decline to hear an appeal of the Carlsbad plant,” said Coastkeeper Legal Director Gabriel Solmer. “Unfortunately, the political pressure to approve the project has been so great; common sense has been dismissed along with the petition to review this flawed and incomplete permit.” <br /><br />The State Water Board’s announcements came amidst two recent reports—the research paper An Investigation of the Marginal Cost of Seawater Desalination in California and the Tampa Bay Times piece “Water rates could go up by 8 percent”—that further demonstrate the ongoing concerns and impacts of desalination projects.<br /><br />According to the Tampa Bay Times, even though residents in the Florida counties of Pinellas, Pasco and Hillsborough have reduced demand for water, their rates will continue to rise because of the utility’s investment in a reservoir and the nation’s biggest desalination plant, also built by Poseidon Resources. The Times reports that “to save money, the utility expects to operate its desal plant—which has a capacity of 25 million gallons a day—at an average of just 8 million gallons a day. Water from the desal plant is the most expensive that the utility produces because of the cost of power and treatment chemicals.”<br /><br />Also released this week, environmental scientist James Fryer’s report concluded that while plants suggest marginal costs of $800 to $1,000 per acre-foot, the realistic estimates will range closer to $2,000 to $3,000 per acre-foot. His investigation to clarify the costs of desalinated water examined many projects including Tampa Bay, Carlsbad, Santa Barbara and Marin.<br /><br />“We are not opposed to desalination,” said Solmer, “We are for responsible water supply choices.  Given the recent news on the Tampa Bay plant, the research into actual costs to desalinate water and the State Board’s policy on the cooling technology, the Carlsbad plant simply doesn’t live up to our needs.”<br /><br />Coastkeeper is currently providing comments on the State Board’s Once-Through-Cooling Policy and evaluating the State Board’s dismissal for possible future action.<br /><br />#    #    #  <br /><br />Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects the region’s bays, beaches, watersheds and ocean for the people and wildlife that depend on them. We balance community outreach, education, and advocacy to promote stewardship of clean water and a healthy coastal ecosystem.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Decision affirms the need to move the cleanup process forward</p> <p><span></span></p>  <!--more-->  <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>SAN DIEGO, CA – July 14, 2010-- Today the San Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board (Regional Board) reaffirmed the need to move forward with the process to clean up contaminated sediment in San Diego Bay. The decision comes nearly twenty years after the Regional Board first considered the issue.</p> <p>David King, the Regional Board chairman and San Diego Bay sediment cleanup hearing officer, denied a request from Regional Board staff and potentially responsible parties to extend the discovery schedule in the hearing process, which could have slowed progress. Chairman King also ended a two-year mediation to set cleanup levels and outline the cleanup schedule.</p> <p>Chairman King characterized the request as a delay tactic, noting that the potentially responsible parties have had months to act but have not used the time to conduct meaningful discovery on issues related to the cleanup.  The Chairman also reprimanded his own staff for not moving forward with the environmental review process in a timely manner, calling it “criminal negligence to be hamstrung by the dischargers.”</p> <p>Environmental and community members have been advocating for the bay cleanup for decades and applaud Chairman King’s decision to move ahead with the environmental review process.</p> <p>“We share Chairman King’s obvious frustration with the delay,” said Gabriel Solmer, legal director for San Diego Coastkeeper. “We’re gratified that he finally said ‘no more’ to the mediation, ending a process that we found dysfunctional and far from transparent.”</p> <p>San Diego Coastkeeper, the region’s leading environmental nonprofit protecting inland and coastal waters, will continue to participate in the formal process to adopt a Cleanup and Abatement Order for the contaminated bay sediments. The process will culminate with a Regional Board hearing and vote, likely in early 2011.</p> <p>“If what is past is prologue, we still have a long road before the toxic sediment is removed,” said Solmer, “but we commend Chairman King for recognizing the delay and moving one step closer toward a clean and healthy bay.”</p> <p>#   #   #</p> <p>Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects the region’s inland and coastal waters for the communities and wildlife that depend on them by blending education, community empowerment and advocacy.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>6-2 Vote Paves the Way for Future Indirect Potable Reuse for San Diego</p> <p><span></span></p>  <!--more-->  <p>SAN  DIEGO, CA  – July 27, 2010 - The San Diego City Council voted 6-2 on Tuesday to approve the design, build &amp; operate (DBO) contract for a demonstration project that will assess the potential to use highly treated wastewater to augment local reservoirs. Specifically, the $6.6M contract with Camp Dresser McKee (CDM) entails design, installation and operation of a demonstration-scale Advanced Water Purification (AWP) Facility at the existing North City Water Reclamation Plant. <br /><br />The AWP will not discharge water into local reservoirs, but will test whether water treated through the facility could safely be used to enhance local drinking water supplies. If the demonstration project is successful, a full-scale project could ultimately provide up to 16 million gallons per day (MGD) of advanced treated water from the North City facility to augment the San Vicente Reservoir, a local drinking water source, as outlined in the City of San Diego’s 2005 Water Reuse Study. The City is concurrently undertaking an assessment to determine whether additional reclamation facilities could be built throughout the region to reclaim even more wastewater. <br /><br />Project proponents contend that water reclamation, such as Indirect Potable Reuse (IPR), can provide a safe, reliable, drought-proof and cost effective supply of local water that will help reduce San Diego’s reliance on imported drinking water while improving the environment by decreasing sewage discharges to the ocean.<br /><br />“Orange County has been safely reclaiming 70 MGD of wastewater to augment its water supplies through groundwater injection for several years,” noted Coastkeeper’s Executive Director Bruce Reznik. “The AWP will bring San Diego one step closer to following their lead and realizing our goal of water independence.”    <br /><br />Because San Diego would be the first City in California to use highly treated wastewater to augment reservoirs rather than groundwater, the City is required by the California Department of Public Health to undertake the demonstration project. Reservoir augmentation, though, has been done safely in other states, including Virginia since 1978, as well as internationally. The design-build-operate contract is the final step in the AWP, following Council approval of the demonstration project in 2007, approval of a rate increase to fund the project in 2008, and subsequent contracts for project management, community outreach, an independent advisory panel, and technical studies.  <br /><br />“We applaud the leadership and perseverance of the City Council to move this project forward,” added Reznik. “I would like to thank those elected officials who have long been advocates of water reclamation, including Council President Ben Hueso, Councilmembers Marti Emerald, Donna Frye and Todd Gloria, and former Councilmembers Scott Peters, Jim Madaffer and Toni Atkins. I would also like to thank Council President Pro Tem Kevin Faulconer and Councilmember Tony Young for taking the time to do extensive due diligence and now supporting this important project.”<br /><br />The AWP was supported by the IPR Coalition, an unprecedented alliance of San Diego environmental, business, labor, economic growth, technical and ratepayer advocates that have come together to promote indirect potable reuse for the region.<br /><br />“The public is becoming increasingly aware of the need to explore all options to enhance our local water supplies,” noted San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce Chairman Tom Wornham, a member of the IPR Coalition. “If San Diego wants to continue to attract and retain leading research and manufacturing businesses, we must aggressively pursue all reliable sources of water to ensure dependable supply at pricing which does not dramatically shift from year to year.” <br /><br />San Diego currently imports over 80% of its water from sources that are steadily declining, including the Colorado River and San Joaquin Delta. “The AWP is just the first step in pursuing water reclamation in the region, “concluded Reznik. “We must stay engaged in monitoring the demonstration project and, if the AWP proves successful, advocating for full-scale implementation if we are to achieve the goal of water security for San Diego.”<br /><br />#    #    #  <br /> <br />Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects the region’s inland and coastal waters for the communities and wildlife that depend on them by blending education, community empowerment and advocacy.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>San Diego Coastkeeper’s free event discusses how an oil spill could impact the region<br /><span></span></p>  <!--more-->  <p>SAN DIEGO, August 6, 2010- San Diego Coastkeeper, the region’s leading environmental nonprofit protecting inland and coastal waters, will host its quarterly Signs of the Tide public forum on Thursday, August 26, from 6 p.m. – 8 p.m. The event at the California Center for Sustainable Energy, located at 8690 Balboa Ave., Suite 100, includes a panel presentation followed by small group discussions examining the likelihood of an oil spill in San Diego, how it would impact the region and steps residents can take to prevent such a disaster.<br /><br />“Signs of the Tide educate, engage and empower San Diegans in issues relating to the health of our inland and coastal waters,” said Coastkeeper Executive Director Bruce Reznik. “As our nation witnesses impacts from the oil spill catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico, it’s important we understand the vulnerability of our own shoreline and how individual and collective choices can make a difference.”<br /><br />KPBS Reporter and Producer Ed Joyce will moderate the August 26 Signs of the Tide, featuring presentations from:<br /><br />•    Office of Oil Spill Prevention and Response<br />•    Dr. Steve Weisberg Executive Director, Southern California Coastal Water Research Project; and <br />•    Debbie Cook, Former Mayor of Huntington Beach and Advisory Board Member of Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas – USA. <br /><br />The Office of Oil Spill Prevention and Response (OSPR) is responsible for protecting California’s inland and coastal waters from oil spills. After the 1989 Exxon Valdez spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil and the American Trader spilled approximately 300,000 gallons of crude oil, the State of California recognized a need to properly protect the state’s natural resources and prevent future oil spills. As a result, the state created OSPR and works to ensure that prevention, preparedness, restoration and response will provide the best protection for California’s natural resources.<br /><br />Debbie Cook is the former mayor of Huntington Beach, California. She has served on the boards of numerous entities, including the Southern California Association of Governments Regional Council (SCAG), the Post Carbon Institute, the Orange County Council of Governments, the Desalination Task Force and the Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas - USA.

		<title>September 1 - Recycling Bins on Local Beaches Make Big Impact During Summer Holidays</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The San Diego Clean Beach Coalition expects recycling rates to soar again Labor Day Weekend</p> <p><span></span></p>  <!--more-->  <p>September 1, 2010 -- San Diego, CA – The San Diego Clean Beach Coalition is preparing local beaches for an increase in both visitors and trash this Labor Day weekend. While City infrastructure proves sufficient to collect debris on typical weekends, the large invasion of beachgoers over busy holiday weekends creates a need for heightened attention to litter prevention. To help, the Coalition acquires sponsors to support the purchase and placement of more than 200 temporary trash and recycle bins for major summer holidays, 45 of which are used over Labor Day weekend.</p> <p>Earlier this year, the City of San Diego Parks &amp; Recreation Department reported that crews removed 197 tons (394,000 pounds) of trash from the bins over the 4th of July weekend. Recycling diversion rates soared, with an additional 27 tons (54,000 pounds) collected in recycling bins placed conveniently on the shore. As beachgoers make the sustainable choice to recycle when given the opportunity, this indicates a need for increasing opportunities for recycling on the beach year-round.</p> <p>This weekend, beachgoers can find the temporary trash and recycling bins on the sand in the areas of Ocean Beach, Mission Beach, Mission Bay Park and Pacific Beach.</p> <p>The Clean Beach Coalition, which consists of local environmental organizations, community groups, and government agencies, has come together for the third consecutive year to raise awareness of beach litter issues and prevent marine debris. Clean Beach Coalition member agencies include: FreePB.org, I Love A Clean San Diego, San Diego Coastkeeper, the San Diego Chapter of Surfrider Foundation, and the City of San Diego Parks &amp; Recreation Department.</p> <p>This year, they raised close to $15,000 from local businesses and government agencies, including Think Blue, City of San Diego Storm Water Department, San Diego County Board of Supervisors – Pam Slater-Price, and Pacific Beach Shore Club. In addition to coordinating the bins, the Coalition also develops education pieces to spread awareness about preventing marine debris. This included “Don’t Forget Your Trash” posters and prevention announcements on local radio stations.</p> <p>More information about the San Diego Clean Beach Coalition member agencies as well as businesses that have helped to support this year’s efforts is available at www.cleanbeachcoalition.org.</p> <p><em>The San Diego Clean Beach Coalition is a collaboration of local non-profit organizations and city agencies focused on coastal stewardship, raising awareness of beach litter issues, and preventing marine debris.</em><br />###</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>San Diego Coastkeeper® looks to local cities for continued leadership</p> <p><span></span></p>  <!--more-->  <p>SAN DIEGO, September 1, 2010- During the final hours of the state’s legislative session, California State Senators voted 14 – 21 to reject AB 1998, a statewide bill that would have banned single-use plastic bags. The bill was intended to help shift the public to reusable bags by prohibiting grocery stores, pharmacies and convenience stores from offering free single-use bags.</p> <p>An alliance of environmental, business and community groups supported the bill, which had already passed the state Assembly and a number of Senate committees. The Governor’s office had publicly encouraged the Senate to pass the bill and said he would sign it if it came to his desk before the end of the legislative session at midnight yesterday.</p> <p>Locally, San Diego Coastkeeper, the San Diego Chapter of the Surfrider Foundation and a number of active individuals helped garner support for the bill and communicate the positive impacts it would have in the county. In San Diego County alone, four cities (Chula Vista, Imperial Beach, Solana Beach and Del Mar), ten City Council members, two Port Commissioners, one County supervisor, three waste management associations, the San Diego Green Chamber of Commerce, and hundreds of individuals wrote or signed letters of support for AB 1998, showing widespread support for plastic reduction in the region.</p> <p>Senator Christine Kehoe, Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, reflected the wishes of her district by showing leadership when the bill was on the floor and in her committee. However, South Bay Senator Denise Ducheny and North County Senator Mark Wyland both voted against the bill, despite hundreds of requests from their constituents to support it. San Diego Coastkeeper also met with their offices repeatedly to educate them about the benefits of reducing single-use plastics.</p> <p>Environmental groups proposed the bill because it would have dramatically reduced the number of non-biodegradable bags in the environment and help tackle the overwhelming amount of plastic marine debris in the Pacific Ocean. The California Grocers Association actively lobbied for the bill because of the costs of free single-use bags and the growing patchwork of regulations created as cities pass their own ordinances. Waste managers supported the bill because plastic bags are inefficient to recycle and gum-up trash sorting machinery, thus filling up landfills.</p> <p>The bill’s active opposition came primarily from the American Chemistry Council, a petro-chemical industry and plastic lobbying group who reportedly provided campaign contributions to a number of California senators voting against the bill.<br />San Diego Coastkeeper looks forward to working with San Diego County municipalities to implement ordinances restricting single-use plastic distribution and continuing to push for statewide, uniform policies for reducing marine debris.</p> <p>###<br /> <br />Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects the region’s inland and coastal waters for the communities and wildlife that depend on them by blending education, community empowerment and advocacy.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>$15,000 donation will fund Coastkeeper's support of wastewater recycling</p> <p><span></span></p>  <!--more-->  <p>SAN DIEGO, September 17, 2010  – San Diego Coastkeeper®, the region’s leading environmental nonprofit protecting inland and coastal waters, won a $15,000 grant from the Save the Colorado River Campaign Fund. The donation will help Coastkeeper advocate for and educate the public about wastewater recycling—called indirect potable reuse—a reliable and safe way to diversify the region’s dwindling imported water supply. <br /><br />Currently, San Diego imports more than 80 percent of its water, including transports from the Colorado River, the region’s second major source for water. According to the Save the Colorado Campaign, San Diego’s drain on the river combined with needs from other regions has pushed the Upper Colorado River at the top of the basin in Colorado to become one of the “Most Endangered Rivers in America.” The river is drained completely dry at the bottom near the Arizona/Mexico border; and in between, the river is so depleted that water and electricity supplies are threatened for the entire Southwest U.S. <br /><br />“The status quo is no longer working,” said Gary Wockner, Campaign Coordinator for the Save the Colorado Campaign.  “The river is nearing a complete crisis, which may also be an economic crisis for the Southwest U.S.  Through the Campaign Fund’s granting efforts, we are trying to support innovative projects and stimulate new activism all along the basin to help keep the river alive.”<br /><br />In addition to the grant to San Diego Coastkeeper to support recycling wastewater into city drinking water, the Save the Colorado Fund made $150,000 worth of grants to ten environmental groups from the top of the river basin all the way to the bottom – all working to protect and restore the Colorado River.</p> <p>###</p> <p>Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects the region’s inland and coastal waters for the communities and wildlife that depend on them by blending education, community empowerment and advocacy.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Coordinators ask expected 10,000 participants to bring own reusable buckets, gloves, bottles</p> <p><span></span></p>  <!--more-->  <p>San Diego, Calif. –More than 6,000 volunteers have already registered for California Coastal Cleanup Day, which will happen on Saturday, September 25, from 9 a.m. to noon. Part of the largest volunteer event in the state, Coastal Cleanup Day in San Diego has more than 80 sites and will attract participants of all ages, who are expected to help clean up in excess of 150,000 pounds of trash in just one morning. Complete event information, cleanup site details and online registration are now available at www.cleanupday.org.  <br /><br />In an effort to reduce waste generated while removing litter from local beaches, bays, parks, canyons and open spaces, Coastal Cleanup Day coordinators request that volunteers bring their own reusable buckets, work gloves and water bottles.  Coordinators will give reusable event tote bags to participants so they can continue to incorporate this Bring Your Own campaign every day.  <br /><br />Last year, approximately 10,200 volunteers scoured 168 miles of coastline and inland areas removing more than 174,000 pounds of trash—the equivalent in weight to three mature gray whales or 30 hummers. In 2009, the top five most common pieces of trash picked up by Coastal Cleanup Day volunteers included cigarettes, food containers, bottle caps and lids, plastic bags and straws. The most prevalent items found at inland cleanup sites include discarded tires and shopping carts.<br /><br />The event is co-coordinated locally by San Diego Coastkeeper and I Love a Clean San Diego. The organizations use data cards and report to the Ocean Conservancy to record important information about the potential sources and common problematic types of marine debris. Without Coastal Cleanup Day, these items would continue to plague outdoor areas where families live and play, and spread to bays and beaches as they travel downstream. Volunteers help to stop this problem at its source and spread firsthand awareness about the connection between littering and pollution.  <br /><br />California Coastal Cleanup Day would not be possible without the generosity of event sponsors. Presenting sponsors include San Diego County Board of Supervisors through the support from Supervisor Greg Cox and Supervisor Pam Slater-Price, and Think Blue - City of San Diego Storm Water Department. Other major sponsors include Bank of America, Ralphs, the Sempra Energy Foundation, Allied Waste Services and many others. Statewide support for the effort is provided by the California Coastal Commission. A complete list of San Diego County event sponsors can be found at www.cleanupday.org/sponsors.htm. <br /><br />###<br /><br />CALIFORNIA COASTAL CLEANUP DAY is a volunteer event 26 years in the making, with more communities, cities and counties joining every year. Through a partnership with California Coastal Commission and Ocean Conservancy, volunteers track types of debris found to compile and learn the sources of marine debris worldwide. I Love A Clean San Diego and San Diego Coastkeeper co-coordinate this event in San Diego County. More details about each organization can be found online at www.cleansd.org and localhost/sdcoastkeeper</p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Volunteers brought their own buckets and gloves to reduce plastic waste from the event</em><br /><br /><span></span></p> <p><span> </span></p>  <!--more-->  <p>San Diego, Calif. – San Diego County’s largest volunteer event removed trash and debris from 86 sites this morning as part of the 26th Annual California Coastal Cleanup Day. Coordinators San Diego Coastkeeper and I Love A Clean San Diego saw record-breaking registration and anticipate that roughly 10,000 community members removed 50 tons of trash. Local elected officials and event sponsors, including County Supervisor Greg Cox, joined hundreds of volunteers to kick off the cleanup event at Rose Creek in Pacific Beach. <br /> <br />“Coastal Cleanup Day is one of the most important events each year in San Diego because it brings together so many San Diegans to protect our environment,” said County Supervisor Greg Cox, a regular supporter of the event. “Keeping our waters clean and protecting the public’s health is one of the highest priorities for me and the County of San Diego, and I’m excited to be here again this year to support the effort.” <br /> <br />Volunteers used data cards to record the types and amount of trash removed during the three-hour event. Types of trash collected ranged from cigarette butts, plastic bags, food wrappers and shopping carts to more unexpected items including: fake antlers, a mannequin, a bongo drum, and an antique leather football helmet. The 2010 cleanup campaign encouraged volunteers to bring their own reusable items to use during the cleanup, thus reducing the amount of plastic waste generated from the cleanup itself. Many volunteers also received reusable tote bags upon arrival to promote more sustainable daily habits.<br /> <br />Cleanup sites stretched from Oceanside to San Ysidro and Ocean Beach to Alpine, allowing volunteers to help out their neighborhood waterways rather than traveling miles to clean only beaches. The kayak cleanup in Mission Bay and the underwater cleanup at the Embarcadero helped remove trash that had already reached the ocean after falling from human hands. Trash in the ocean, or marine debris, causes great concern to conservation groups because it can persist for many years and harms wildlife. Cleanups like Coastal Cleanup Day help stop the flow of debris from streets and parks to the ocean. <br /> <br />Local Coastal Cleanup Day coordinators San Diego Coastkeeper and I Love a Clean San Diego appreciate those who gave their morning to the environment and encourage those who may have missed today’s event to seek other ways to get involved. Both organizations coordinate dozens of cleanup events each year as well as a variety of other environmentally focused service projects. Through ongoing volunteerism, the coordinators are able to significantly impact the health of local beaches, waterways and inland areas. Volunteers today helped to stop trash at its source and spread firsthand awareness about the connection between littering and pollution. See www.cleansd.org or localhost/sdcoastkeeper for more information.<br /> <br />California Coastal Cleanup Day would not be possible without the generosity of event sponsors. Presenting sponsors included San Diego County Board of Supervisors through the support from Supervisor Greg Cox and Supervisor Pam Slater-Price, and Think Blue - City of San Diego Storm Water Department. Other major sponsors included Bank of America, Ralphs, the Sempra Energy Foundation, Allied Waste Services and many others. Statewide support for the effort is provided by the California Coastal Commission. A complete list of San Diego County event sponsors can be found at www.cleanupday.org/sponsors.htm.</p> <p><br />###<br /> <br />CALIFORNIA COASTAL CLEANUP DAY is a volunteer event 26 years in the making, with more communities, cities and counties joining every year. Through a partnership with California Coastal Commission and Ocean Conservancy, volunteers track types of debris found to compile and learn the sources of marine debris worldwide. I Love A Clean San Diego and San Diego Coastkeeper co-coordinate this event in San Diego County. More details about each organization can be found online at www.cleansd.org and localhost/sdcoastkeeper.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Review reveals cities fail to identify pollutants produced by local sources</em></p> <p><span></span></p>  <!--more-->  <p>SAN DIEGO, CA – September 27, 2010-- San Diego Coastkeeper,® the region’s leading environmental nonprofit protecting inland and coastal waters, completed its audit of North County stormwater programs including Carlsbad, Vista, Oceanside, and San Marcos, along with aspects of San Diego County’s program. Coastkeeper discovered that none of the cities audited had identified the main pollutants for each of its industrial and commerical facilities, a key requirement of the regional stormwater permit’s annual reporting requirements.  <br /><br />“Without knowing which pollutants come from which sources, the cities and interested members of the public do not have the information they need to target the sources that most contribute to the pollution problems in our local waters,” said Jill Witkowski, San Diego Coastkeeper’s staff attorney.<br /><br />The audit examined several aspects of the stormwater programs, including compliance with the San Diego Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System permit, inspection of nurseries in the Agua Hedionda hydrologic area, enforcement actions taken by the cities and public access to stormwater documents. Coastkeeper compiled a report highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each city’s stormwater program in the areas reviewed and providing action areas for all cities. The report is available for <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=73:protecting-san-diego-from-urban-runoff&amp;catid=40&amp;Itemid=104">download online</a>.<br /><br />San Diego Coastkeeper hopes that the audit will help each of the cities reviewed to improve its stormwater program and assist the cities in working together to improve water quality in the Agua Hedionda watershed.  The results from the audit have also been shared with the San Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board to improve the next version of the regional stormwater permit. San Diego Coastkeeper hopes to continue working collaboratively with the cities and the Regional Board to use the audit results to improve stormwater programs and water quality in the region.<br /><br />###<br /><br />Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects the region’s inland and coastal waters for the communities and wildlife that depend on them by blending education, community empowerment and advocacy.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Coastkeeper works to secure scientifically based zones for San Diego’s sites</p> <p><span></span></p>  <!--more-->  <p>SAN DIEGO, Oct. 13, 2010- On Wednesday, Oct. 20, at the Four Points by Sheraton, the California Fish &amp; Game Commission will hear final public discussion on marine protected areas in Southern California. This is the last public discussion on the issue and the first Southern California-based meeting of the year on marine protected areas. At its Dec. 15-16 meeting in Santa Barbara, the Commission is expected to vote into law the approved network of marine protected areas for the southern region.<br /><br />San Diego Coastkeeper, the region’s leading environmental nonprofit protecting inland and coastal waters, has worked with a group of over 100 people since September 2008 to design the network of marine protected areas in Southern California that will stretch from Point Conception in Santa Barbara to the Mexican border. Coastkeeper has focused its effort on defining San Diego’s three primary conservation zones in Imperial Beach, south La Jolla and at Swamis in Encinitas. <br /><br />“We want the Fish &amp; Game Commission to select Proposal 3, the conservation plan, because it will best serve the people and wildlife of San Diego,” said Coastkeeper Marine Conservation Manager Meagan Wylie. “Marine protected areas have a long history of environmental success in many other parts of the world, the most effective of which tend to be the largest. According to the team of scientists who helped guide Southern California’s marine protected area design process, the bare minimum size needed to make an impact is nine-square-miles. Proposal 3 will establish this minimum protection along few select areas of our coastline. The other proposals being considered fall short of this critical requirement.”<br /><br />Akin to “underwater state parks,” marine protected areas set aside sensitive ecosystems to allow marine life and habitats an opportunity to recover and thrive. Since its adoption in 1999, the Marine Life Protection Act required implementation of these areas along the state’s entire coastline <br /><br />Scientific studies of over 80 marine reserves worldwide, 30 of which are in habitats similar to California’s, have shown that reserves (one type of marine protected area where no extractive activities, like fishing, are allowed) placed in California-like habitats allow the fish and other animals to more than double their population size and grow 30 percent larger than animals outside reserves. Recent research also shows that as numbers of fish increase inside marine reserves, fish are more likely to “spillover” into surrounding areas and benefit local fisheries.<br /><br />The Fish &amp; Game Commission will holds its meeting on Oct. 20 at the Four Points by Sheraton at 8110 Aero Drive in San Diego. The marine protected areas public discussion and hearing is expected to take all day, beginning at 10 a.m. Participants wanting to show their support for marine protected areas need only show and register to be counted. They will not be required to stay for the entire meeting.<br /><br />For more information about marine protected areas and the Fish &amp; Game Commission meeting on Oct. 20, visit Coastkeeper’s website at localhost/sdcoastkeeper. <br /><br />###<br /><br />Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects the region’s inland and coastal waters for the communities and wildlife that depend on them by blending education, community empowerment and advocacy.

Over 130 businesses from around the state submitted letters to the California State Fish and Game Commission, which will meet Oct. 20 in San Diego. The list of businesses, elected officials and organizations who endorse marine protected areas is available online (<a href="learn/marine-conservation/endorsements-of-mpas.html">http://localhost/sdcoastkeeper/learn/marine-conservation/endorsements-of-mpas.html</a>).<br /><br />The Marine Life Protection Act will result in the creation of a community-designed, science-based system of marine protected areas stretching the length of California’s coast.  These protected areas are like underwater state parks that protect sensitive sea life and habitats while providing recreational, educational and study opportunities for people.<br /><br />Patagonia, Horny Toad Activewear, Avalon Capital Group, Rieman Surf School, Prudential California Realty, Groundswell Technologies, Inc., Cabrillo Marine Aquarium, SEA LIFE Aquarium at LEGOLAND®, Living Sea Images, Reef Seekers Dive Co., the K Nathan Gallery in San Diego and more than 100 other businesses urged the state to invest in ocean protection: <br /><br />According to the National Ocean Economics Program, the California coastal economy is responsible for supporting more than 15 million jobs in 2008 while paying more than $797 billion in wages to those in the sector.  Our coastal economy depends on abundant fish and wildlife, healthy ecosystems, and clean beaches and ocean waters.   Visitors from around the world come to experience the beautiful and bountiful California coast.  They stay in our hotels, eat at our restaurants and spend money on a range of goods and services from postcards to surf lessons.<br /><br />With coastal economic activities accounting for 83 percent of the U.S. economy, ocean protection is good for business.  A science-based network of Marine Protected Areas can help safeguard those valuable resources and support the long-term economic vitality of coastal communities.</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>According to the National Ocean Economics Program, the California coastal economy is responsible for supporting more than 15 million jobs in 2008 while paying more than $797 billion in wages to those in the sector.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>{readmorelink}Read the full article...{/readmorelink}</p>  <!--more-->  <p>SAN DIEGO- Oct. 20, 2010- Nearly 700 supporters of marine protected areas (MPAs) filed into an over-capacity meeting room at the Four Points by Sheraton for today’s California Fish and Game Commission meeting. Amidst a sea of blue shirts—the color worn by those supporting marine protected areas (MPAs)-- students, surfers, elected officials, divers, fishers, business leaders and conservationists urged the commission to choose a strong network of MPAs for the Southern California coastline. Today’s meeting was the last public hearing regarding implementation of the Marine Life Protection Act before the Fish &amp; Game Commission approves in December an established network of MPAs—akin to underwater parks-- in Southern California.<br /><br />San Diego Coastkeeper representatives estimate attendance at more than 1,000 people. According to Coastkeeper’s Kate Hanley, the majority of participants expressed their support for the strongest possible MPA network for the south coast. <br /><br />“We’ve been waiting for 11 years,” said San Diego resident and south La Jolla spearfisherman Mike Laude. “It’s about time the Fish &amp; Game Commission did their job to protect our ocean so that we have fish for future generations.”<br /><br />At today’s meeting, local supporters of all ages and interests shared their reasons for requesting the commission to preserve habitats along San Diego’s coastline. Over a half dozen local schools, complete with speeches and student projects, attended the meeting to express their concerns about preserving ocean habitats. Coastkeeper representatives presented support postcards for MPAs in south La Jolla and at Swamis in Encinitas that more than 550 San Diego residents signed. All together, the commission received more than 3,000 of the postcards expressing the need for MPAs along the south coast. Other presenters gave the commission support letters signed by kayakers, fisherman and ocean enthusiasts.<br /><br />“According to a Public Policy Institute of California poll, more than 70 percent of Southern Californians support strong marine protection. That was certainly reflected in the diversity of ocean user groups speaking up today asking for the greatest possible protections along our coast,” said Hanley. “With more than 60 public meetings and 100 hours of comment over the past two years, it’s time for the commission to set in place a strong network of marine protected areas that the public wants.”<br /><br />In addition to the letters of support from individuals, a Coastkeeper representative presented the commission with a signed statement of consensus from more than 135 businesses in California that endorse MPAs, and that join the growing list of 59 elected officials who have publicly stated their support.<br /><br />“This is an issue that is near and dear to all of our residents’ hearts,” said City of Encinitas Deputy Mayor Maggie Houlihan in her public testimony to the commission. In talking about MPAs, she said they “protect the present and future quality of life for the economic vitality of our beaches” and asked the commission for the “highest level of protection at Swamis.”  <br /><br />Other elected officials in attendance at the meeting supporting strong protections for Southern California coastline included City of Del Mar Councilmember Crystal Crawford, Redondo Beach Councilmember Bill Brand, San Diego Unified School District Board President Richard Barrera and former Mayor of Laguna Beach Ann Christoph and representatives from the offices of State Senator Christine Kehoe, Congressman Bob Filner and Supervisor Pam Slater-Price. <br /><br />The final Fish &amp; Game Commission meeting, where it will sign into law the network of marine protected areas in Southern California, will take place in Santa Barbara in December.<br /><br />###<br /><br />Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects the region’s inland and coastal waters for the communities and wildlife that depend on them by blending education, community empowerment and advocacy.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Community unites to retire aging plant after decade battle</p>  <!--more-->  <p>SAN DIEGO- Oct. 26, 2010- With a one-page withdrawal of its permit renewal application, South Bay Power Plant’s operator Dynegy took the final step to ensure the plant will cease operations by December 31 of this year. After five decades on San Diego Bay, the era of the South Bay Power Plant is at an end. <br /><br />Environmental groups have focused attention on the discharge permit renewal and the perceived need to keep the plant operating to produce power for the region.&nbsp; Those groups hailed the California Independent Systems Operator’s (ISO) recent decision to remove 'reliability must run' status from the Plant, which led to Dynegy’s withdrawal. The ISO, a state agency charged with keeping electric grid liability, had determined in September that the aging power plant was necessary to keep San Diego's power flowing in 2011. However, due in part to intense public pressure to decommission the plant, the ISO reversed its decision on October 15. Based on that finding, Dynegy has withdrawn its application.<br /><br />“The defeat of the power plant is a significant victory in that the power of community unity carried the day,” said Laura Hunter, Associate Director for Programs at Environmental Health Coalition. “It was the pulling together of the residents, the organizations, and governments that, in the end, brought about improvements to our community and the bay.&nbsp;It shows, once again, that a community united can never be defeated.”  For a decade, the battle to retire the plant has been led by the Environmental Health Coalition with the support of community groups and water quality watchdogs like San Diego Coastkeeper.<br /><br />"This is such a victory for the communities impacted by the plant for the past half a century,” said Coastkeeper Legal Director Gabriel Solmer. &nbsp;"We are finally able to give this part of the bay back to the people and wildlife to enjoy.”<br /><br /> The plant used an antiquated technology called 'once-through-cooling’ as its cooling system. The technology requires massive amounts of water, along with the aquatic life contained in the water column, to be sucked into the plant and spewed out ten to 15 degrees hotter. This super heated water has created a dead zone in the South Bay where eelgrass, a key habitat and food source for bay species, could grow.  <br /><br />"This plant has been more than an eyesore," said Solmer.&nbsp;“The air quality impacts on downwind residents, and the heat and pollution in the water have taken their toll on the health of the bay. Hopefully with the closure of the plant we will start to see life returning to this incredible area of San Diego.”<br /><br />###<br /><br />Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects the region’s inland and coastal waters for the communities and wildlife that depend on them by blending education, community empowerment and advocacy.

More than three million people live in San Diego County now, with more than 700,000 more expected within 30 years. The question is, how we will ever find enough water?”<br /><br />Voiceofsandiego.org Senior Writer Rob Davis will moderate the panel, consisting of:<br /><br />•    David Pierce, Analyst, Climate Research Division, Scripps Institute of Oceanography, UCSD<br />•    Brook Sarson, Rainwater Harvesting and Water Reuse Professional, H2OME<br />•    Bruce Reznik, San Diego Coastkeeper Executive Director<br />•    Additional environmental activist(s) sharing firsthand knowledge of the state’s collective impact to the river systems <br /><br />Following the presentations, attendees will then have an opportunity to further delve into the topic via group discussions and Q&amp;A led by Davis.<br /><br />Signs of the Tide, sponsored by SDG&amp;E Smart Meter and Cook &amp; Schmid, are community events designed to educate, engage and empower participants in issues relating to the health of San Diego’s coastal waters. The meetings rotate locations throughout San Diego. All events are free, open to the community and include light snacks and beverages.  <br /><br />For more information about Signs of the Tide, visit Coastkeeper’s website at localhost/sdcoastkeeper. <br />###<br />Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects the region’s inland and coastal waters for the communities and wildlife that depend on them by blending education, community empowerment and advocacy.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Volunteers collect water samples from nine of the 11 watersheds</p> <p>{readmorelink}Read the full article...{/readmorelink}</p>  <!--more-->  <p>SAN DIEGO, Nov. 3, 2010- San Diego Coastkeeper, San Diego’s largest professional environmental organization working to protect inland and coastal waters, is running their watershed monitoring program this month on Saturday, November 20th at 9:00 a.m.  San Diego Coastkeeper trains more than 100 volunteers annually to collect monthly surface water quality information in nine of 11 watersheds in San Diego County.  Coastkeeper’s watershed monitoring program is essential to establishing water quality trends in the county’s creeks and rivers, helping improve government decision making regarding local water bodies, and creating a team of trained citizen volunteers who connect with their local ecosystem. Coastkeeper’s monitoring of these water bodies is the most frequent in the county.<br /><br />“Coastkeeper’s volunteer water quality monitoring program is the largest of its kind in the state, and possibly the nation,” said Coastkeeper Executive Director Bruce Reznik.  “Since its inception in 2000, we’ve trained more than 1,000 community members, who are now empowered to help conserve and improve our local water bodies.”<br /><br />Once a month, the Coastkeeper office turns into a training center for volunteers who want to take an active role in environmental conservation.  Volunteers from across the county learn about the importance of San Diego’s watersheds and maintaining their ecological capabilities.  Volunteers are trained to collect and analyze samples in accordance with Coastkeeper’s standard operating procedures and laboratory quality assurance project plan.    New volunteers are paired with returning volunteers to create site teams, headed by watershed captains who are designated to oversee specific watersheds for the year.  While in the field, volunteers use professional quality, calibrated instruments to measure physical and chemical water quality data.   Volunteers also collect samples for later microbial, nutrient, and toxicity analysis.   Each team monitors two to three different designated sites in their watershed. At the end of the day, site teams return the samples to the Coastkeeper lab for analysis.  <br />The data collected help inform staff and the public about watershed health and water quality, and is ultimately used as a tool to help leverage government decision making regarding restoration of local water bodies.  <br /><br />The results from monitoring events, along with watershed information and locations of monitoring sites, are posted online for the public to access.  San Diego Coastkeeper also posts the current beach water quality status on its site, along with the historic beach water quality data in graphs. The watershed information and water quality data can be accessed through Coastkeeper’s site at localhost/sdcoastkeeper.<br /><br />All events are open to community members interested in monitoring water quality. New volunteer trainings take place every other month. For more information, visit Coastkeeper’s website at localhost/sdcoastkeeper, or email Dylan Edwards at dylan@localhost/sdcoastkeeper.<br /><br />###<br />Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects the region’s bays, beaches, watersheds and ocean for the people and wildlife that depend on them.  We balance community outreach, education, and advocacy to promote stewardship of clean water and a healthy coastal ecosystem.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>San Diego Coastkeeper applauds the action, which stems from the organization’s 2009 proposal</p>  <!--more-->  <p>SAN DIEGO, CA-May 18, 2011- Today San Diego Mayor Jerry Sanders’ office and the Environmental Services Division announced a series of administrative regulations to limit the City’s purchase of single-use plastic water bottles and plastic foam products (often inappropriately referred to as Styrofoam™). San Diego Coastkeeper, the region’s largest environmental organization protecting inland and coastal waters, applauds the mayor’s action, which stems from the organization’s 2009 proposal urging the City Council to take the steps. The new guidelines, announced today to the San Diego City Council Natural Resources and Culture Committee (NRC) and effective on January 1, 2012, will reduce the City’s environmental impacts, potentially save money, reinforce confidence in the city’s municipal water system and set a precedent for other cities in the region.<br /><br />The item was brought to the Committee after a December 2010 request from former Chair Donna Frye.&nbsp; Under the strong mayor-strong council form of government, the administrative regulation does not need Council approval.&nbsp; However, showing support for the ideas within the regulation, the NRC requested that the Mayor’s office report on the implementation of these policies at the November 16 NRC meeting. <br /><br />“This will show great leadership to the residents of San Diego,” said City Council Member David Alvarez, who chairs NRC. He also noted that the City is the first in San Diego County to take these initial steps.  </p> <p>Specifically but not inclusively, the Mayor’s administrative regulation will:<br /><br />•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Prohibit the purchase of single-use water bottles and water bottle dispensers with City funds, with the exception of facilities that do not have access to safe tap water to drink<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Prohibit the purchase of plastic foam food service ware with City funds (referred to as expanded polystyrene, or EPS)<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Develop standard language for bids that expresses the City’s commitment to eliminating plastic foam in packing materials, using alternative recyclable packing materials when available and/or vendor take back of the packing materials. This includes working with current vendors to reduce plastic foam use.<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Revise City permit applications; including those for special events, parks and recreation facilities, and water reservoirs and lakes, to prohibit the use of plastic foam food service ware.<br /><br />“We commend Mayor Sanders for demonstrating environmental leadership and fiscal responsibility with his policy limiting the City’s purchase of single-use plastic water bottles and plastic foam products,” said Alicia Glassco, San Diego Coastkeeper’s education and marine debris manager. “We hope the door will remain open to expand the restriction of plastic foam use beyond City events and that other cities will follow the Mayor’s lead and take similar action.”<br /><br />The City of San Diego joins 48 California cities that have already committed to reducing plastic foam for environmental reasons and 28 jurisdictions that have limited bottled water purchases to reduce expenses and support public water systems. <br /><br />“San Francisco canceled its bottled water contracts and saved half a million dollars a year,” said John Stewart, national campaign organizer with&nbsp;Corporate Accountability International. “San Diego will join the ranks of 1,200 cities and five states nationwide that have taken similar steps, saving millions of dollars.”<br /><br />This step by Mayor Sanders comes on the heels of the statewide Senate Bill 568, which would prohibit the distribution and use of plastic foam containers by food vendors. Currently, the senate floor expects the bill sometime next week. Support organizers identified Senator Juan Vargas as a swing vote on the matter and ask that he take this action as a sign that his constituents are calling for reduced litter and debris. <br /><br />San Diego Coastkeeper first proposed restricting bottled water and plastic foam at City facilities and events to former City Councilmember Donna Frye in late 2009. Coastkeeper cited beach cleanup data from across the county, which indicates a growing problem of plastic water bottles, plastic bottle caps and pieces of plastic foam littering the environment. In 2010 alone, volunteers removed more than 25,000 pieces of plastic foam, which is lightweight, floats and easily breaks into small pieces making it a challenge for removal from storm drains and the environment. <br /><br />San Diego Coastkeeper’s website (http://localhost/sdcoastkeeper) hosts more information about <a href="learn/marine-debris/data-from-san-diego-beach-cleanups.html">beach cleanup data in San Diego County</a> and the harmful effects of marine debris on the environmental, marine mammals and humans. <br /><br /><br /># # #<br />San Diego Coastkeeper<br />Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects the region’s inland and coastal waters for the communities and wildlife that depend on them by blending education, community empowerment and advocacy.

Kona Brewing Company will be bringing its annual Liquid Aloha Festival to San Diego on Saturday, July 9 at the NTC Promenade in Liberty Station, Point Loma, starting at 3:00 pm. The Dirty Heads will headline the daylong celebration and 100% of the proceeds from beer sales will benefit San Diego Coastkeeper, a group working to protect San Diego's inland and coastal waters.<br /><br />Kona Brewing will be serving Longboard Island Lager, Fire Rock Pale Ale, and Wailua Wheat on draught throughout the festival. One Drop, Simpkin Project, Sand Section, and the Kalama Brothers will be performing, and festivities wrap up at 9 pm. 21-and-up tickets are $15 and are available at Brown Paper Tickets. A second Liquid Aloha Festival will happen in Orange County on July 23, 2011 with more details forthcoming.<br /><br />This year’s  festival aims to be similar in sustainability values to the Kona Brewer’s Festival, which drastically minimized trash through numerous recycling and composting stations. After a full day of 2,500 people and 42 brewers consuming food and beer, the festival produced only half of a rubbish container, equaling roughly the amount of garbage produced during a typical breakfast period at a fast food establishment.<br /><br />Additional event sponsors are 91X and Pacific Magazine. More info at: www.liquidalohafest.com.</p> <p><strong>About Kona Brewing</strong><br />Kona Brewing Company was started in the spring of 1994 by father and son team Cameron Healy and Spoon Khalsa, who had a dream to create fresh, local island brews made with spirit, passion and quality. It is a Hawaii-born and Hawaii-based craft brewery that prides itself on brewing the freshest beer of exceptional quality, closest to market. This helps to minimize its carbon footprint by reducing shipping of raw materials, finished beer and wasteful packaging materials. The brewery is headquartered where it began, in Kailua-Kona on Hawaii’s Big Island. It has grown into Hawaii’s largest brewery, has three restaurant sites in Hawaii and beer distribution reaching 28 states and Japan. It is the 13th largest craft brewery in the country.

		<title>November 23 - A Day Without A Bag Takes Over San Diego County on December 16</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>{readmorelink}Read the full article...{/readmorelink}</p>  <!--more-->  <p>San Diego, CA – Cities throughout the San Diego region, local community groups, environmental organizations, and the County of San Diego have proclaimed the third Thursday of December as “A Day Without a Bag” to raise awareness and promote a greener holiday season.  <br /><br />On Thursday, December 16, 2010, businesses and residents will promote or utilize reusable bags for their holiday and regular shopping needs instead of standard single-use plastic and paper bags.  <br /><br />“This is a community-wide event to support the development of behavior that is a more sustainable use of our resources by encouraging shoppers to choose reusable shopping bags over disposables. Reuse is far better than recycling – it prevents waste and litter, which in the end is the highest and best use of resources,” stated Regional Coordinator Jacy Bolden.<br /><br />Each year, people in the greater San Diego region use more than 1.7 billion plastic bags, which is about 500 bags per person annually.  According to the U.S. EPA, less than five percent of plastic bags are actually recycled, and they are made from non-renewable fossil fuels.  Even though paper bags are easily recycled in curbside programs, proponents of “A Day Without A Bag” stress that a single-use of any disposable bag is not the highest and best use of natural resources. <br /><br />Over the last two years the cities of Chula Vista, Encinitas, Oceanside and Solana Beach have shown that “Day Without A Bag” efforts in their communities have increased reusable bag use. <br /><br />“Day Without A Bag is going region-wide this year, and we’re thrilled to see such strong early support in coordinating this type of an event. Retailers in the cities that have carried this event out previously have indicated a 20-50% decrease in disposable bag usage. Clearly it’s an effective promotion,” noted Bolden. <br /><br />To make the event possible, retailers and volunteers will give away more than 25,000 reusable shopping bags, while supplies last, at over 100 locations throughout the county.  Retailers currently committed to participate in the event include: all Jimbo’s Natural Foods, Smart &amp; Final, Stater Bros Grocery,  and Target locations; SeaWorld stores; San Diego Padres Team Store; San Diego Zoo and Zoo Safari stores; select Albertsons, Ralphs and Walmart locations; as well as all major grocers in Encinitas, Oceanside and Solana Beach.  <br /><br />Beyond the above retailers, additional bags have been donated or provided by:  Chico Bags, EDCO Waste &amp; Recycling, EnviroSax, Republic/Allied Waste, Think Blue San Diego Region, Surfrider Foundation and the cities of Chula Vista, Encinitas, Lemon Grove, Poway, San Marcos and Santee.  Key financial and in-kind sponsors include SeaWorld, Sycuan Casino, San Diego Union Tribune, and the cities of Chula Vista, Encinitas, and Oceanside.  Environmental organizations coordinating volunteers and promotions countywide include:  San Diego Coastkeeper, I Love A Clean San Diego, Solana Center for Environmental Innovation and the San Diego Chapter of the Surfrider Foundation.<br /><br />Retailers and volunteers interested in participating can find more information about the event by visiting www.NoBagDaySD.org, which also includes a Google map with bag giveaway locations and times.<br />###</p>]]></content:encoded>

A broad-based affiliation of environmental, consumer, business, labor, development, taxpayer and technical organizations, the Water Reliability Coalition selected the new name because it better matches its long-term goals to support the development of a safe, reliable, sustainable and cost-effective local water supply.<br /><br />The group currently focuses on supporting the recently approved City of San Diego Water Purification Demonstration Project, which will test the feasibility of treating wastewater to drinking water standards. The Coalition members recognize that a stable, dependable supply of water is a necessity for San Diego’s growing community. Coalition members support the region investing in local sources for a drought-proof water supply to decrease its dependence on less reliable and ever-more expensive imported water. The Coalition believes that recycling water for potable use can be an important part of San Diego’s water supply portfolio diversification. In the San Diego region, potable reuse could provide one of the most cost-effective and environmentally friendly options to enhance local water supplies.  <br /><br />###<br /><br />The Water Reliability Coalition is a broad-based affiliation of environmental, consumer, business, labor, development, taxpayer and technical organizations that have come together to support exploration of Indirect Potable Reuse as a potential strategy to develop a safe, reliable, sustainable &amp; cost-effective local water supply. <br /><br />Coalition members include: BIOCOM; Building Industry Association; Building Owners and Managers Association, San Diego Chapter; Citizens Coordinate for Century 3; Coastal Environmental Rights Foundation; Empower San Diego; Endangered Habitats League; Environmental Health Coalition; Friends of Infrastructure; Industrial Environmental Association; National Association of Industrial and Office Properties, San Diego Chapter;  San Diego and Imperial Counties Labor Council; San Diego Audubon Society; San Diego Regional Economic Development Corporation; San Diego Coastkeeper; San Diego County Taxpayers Association; San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce; San Diego River Park Foundation; Surfrider Foundation, San Diego Chapter; Sustainability Alliance of Southern California; Utility Consumers’ Action Network</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fish and Game Commission approves network of “underwater parks” including critical protections for some of San Diego’s marine areas</p> <p>{readmorelink} Read the full article... {/readmorelink}</p>  <!--more-->  <p>San Diego – Dec. 15, 2010 – In a landmark decision, the California Fish and Game Commission (FGC) today voted 3-2 to adopt a network of marine protected areas (MPAs) that will stretch from Santa Barbara to the Mexican border.  San Diego’s new MPAs will include locations at Swamis in Encinitas, south La Jolla, Point Loma and Imperial Beach, areas that San Diego Coastkeeper has worked to protect over the past four years. These protected areas will join the existing network of MPAs in the statewide system of underwater parks called for in California’s ocean conservation law, the Marine Life Protection Act (MLPA) adopted with bipartisan support in 1999.</p> <p>The FGC voted in favor of the Integrated Preferred Alternative (IPA), a compromise plan that combines MPA proposals from fishermen, divers, conservationists and scientists. The governor convened a Blue Ribbon Task Force of policy experts to review a selection of MPA proposals created by a group of 64 representatives from Southern California, including a San Diego Coastkeeper representative.  In December 2009, the Task Force unanimously recommended the IPA to the Commission for adoption into law.<br /><br />This afternoon, following lengthy review and before adopting the IPA into law today, the FGC made several small boundary modifications to a selection of the MPAs. These included a slight expansion of the conservation area at Swamis in Encinitas, adding just over a mile of protection at this geography. The Swamis conservation area is the largest in San Diego at over three shoreline miles and ten-square-miles of protected area. It will allow for spear fishing and shore fishing by hook and line gear. <br /><br />The size of the marine reserve at south La Jolla was also expanded by two city blocks so that boundaries would be more easily recognized by the public, providing this area with just over seven-square-miles of critical protection. The reserve in south La Jolla now stretches from Palomar Avenue to Missouri Street in Pacific Beach. In addition, the historic marine protected area at La Jolla shores, stretching to the Scripps pier, has been retained. <br /><br />The MLPA planning effort has sparked an outpouring of public support from elected officials, local businesses, community organizations and scientists. Thousands of San Diegans and Southern Californians attended meetings, made public comments or signed petitions supporting improved ocean protection.<br /><br />“We’ve been working toward this historic vote for more than four years,” said Meagan Wylie, San Diego Coastkeeper’s Marine Conservation Manager. “It’s like a savings account for our ocean—set a little aside so it can recuperate and thrive and we will all—fisherman, residents, recreational users, marine life--benefit from the interest.”  <br /><br />At today’s final meeting in Santa Barbara, the FGC heard testimony from elected officials, conservationists, scientists, fisherman and recreational users, who testified for the Commission to set aside strong marine protection areas for the good of the community.<br /><br />"We are on the side of fishermen, protected areas protect their business," said Jean-Michael Cousteau, the first son of ocean explorer Jacques-Yves Cousteau. “I want future generations to have the same privileges I’ve had.”<br /><br />The compromise IPA plan will protect sea life and habitats at biodiversity hot spots—San Diego’s include south La Jolla and Swamis-- while leaving nearly 90 percent of the coast open for fishing (see a map of fishing areas left open).  The new MPAs will improve access for recreation, study and education while boosting the overall health of California’s ocean.<br /><br />Marine protected areas (MPAs) are a scientifically proven tool for improving the health of marine life and habitat. A five-year review of protections around the Channel Islands has shown that MPAs have greater diversity and productivity than similar fished habitats, without any decline in sportfishing.  <br /><br />“Every place you are considering here today is as worthy of protection as Yellowstone and Yosemite,” said student Adam Livingston in his public testimony.<br /><br />For more information visit localhost/sdcoastkeeper. <br /><br />### <br />Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects the region’s inland and coastal waters for the communities and wildlife that depend on them by blending education, community empowerment and advocacy.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Volunteers removed more than 25,000 pieces of Styrofoam</p> <p>{readmorelink}Read the full article...{/readmorelink}</p>  <!--more-->  <p>SAN DIEGO, CA- Feb. 7, 2011- Cigarette butts, Styrofoam pieces and plastics continue to be the top three most common items found on San Diego County’s beaches, according to data released today by San Diego Coastkeeper and the Surfrider Foundation San Diego Chapter. In partnership since 2003, the environmental organizations conduct twice-monthly beach cleanups throughout the county and ask volunteers to keep detailed records of the debris they remove. The data allows comparisons between clean and dirty beaches; Torrey Pines State Beach had the least trash in 2009 and 2010, while Pacific Beach’s Tourmaline Beach had the most trash collected by volunteer.<br /><br />“We presented this data to the City of San Diego last week and asked council members to not spend taxpayer money on single-use plastic water bottles and Styrofoam food containers, which harm our environment,” said Alicia Glassco, San Diego Coastkeeper’s Education and Marine Debris Manager. <br /><br />Data collection cards from the 2010 cleanups also show: <br /><br />•    Cigarette butts, Styrofoam and “other plastics” are the top three most common items found since 2007. <br />•    Volunteers removed more than 70,000 pieces of plastic from area beaches in 2010. <br />•    Pieces of Styrofoam have increased in three years from 10,000 to nearly 25,000. Interesting items found in 2010 included an electronic keyboard, conveyor belt and soup ladle. <br /><br />“The data highlights the trend of improper disposal of plastics such as single-use plastic bags, Styrofoam, food wrappers and bottles/caps, which do not biodegrade,” said Surfrider Foundation San Diego Chapter Coordinator Bill Hickman. “Cigarette butts remain a serious concern.”<br /><br />In addition to Coastkeeper and Surfrider’s twice-monthly cleanups, both organizations participate in additional special cleanups organized by several local non-profits. When totals from all major area cleanups are combined, nearly 40,000 volunteers collected 635,000 pounds of trash from San Diego waterways and coastal beaches in 2010. <br /><br />Coastkeeper and Surfrider are also announcing the full 2011 schedule, which will again rotate locations of popular beaches throughout the county and are open to all volunteers. At each cleanup, organizers anticipate 100 to 500 people. They do supply bags, gloves and water for those who participate, but request that volunteers bring their own gardening gloves, buckets and reusable water bottles to help reduce plastic usage during the pickup. <br /><br />For more information on San Diego beach cleanups, visit Coastkeeper’s website at localhost/sdcoastkeeper or Surfrider’s website at www.surfriderSD.org.<br /><br /># # #<br /><br />San Diego Coastkeeper<br />Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects the region’s bays, beaches, watersheds and ocean for the people and wildlife that depend on them.  We balance community outreach, education, and advocacy to promote stewardship of clean water and a healthy coastal ecosystem. <br /><br />Surfrider Foundation San Diego Chapter<br />The Surfrider Foundation is a non-profit grassroots organization dedicated to the protection and enjoyment of our world’s oceans, waves and beaches.

		<title>February 10 - High Tides on February 16 - 18 to Illustrate Vulnerability of San Diego’s Shoreline</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Volunteer photography of highest tides to demonstrate potential impacts of sea level rise</p> <p>{readmorelink}Read the full article...{/readmorelink}</p>  <!--more-->  <p>February 8, 2011 – San Diego, Calif. - Next week some of the year’s highest tides will breach California’s coastal and bay shorelines, providing a glimpse of what the state can expect as sea levels rise in the coming years. Local environmental organizations are working within a statewide project to have volunteers in San Diego County document this winter’s highest tides—known as “king tides.” Local organizers, focused on capturing pictures around San Diego Bay to support the current sea level rise adaptation planning process, expect king tides from February 16 – 18 with particularly high tides on February 17 from 7:30 – 9 a.m. San Diego participants will be eligible to win one of three prize packs.<br /><br />Statewide, the organizations will use the photography to help policymakers visualize projected impacts from rising sea levels and take action to protect homes, harbors, airports, and other key infrastructure as well as wetlands, beaches, and public access to the coast. Local partners include Tijuana River National Estuarine Research Reserve, San Diego Coastkeeper, the San Diego Foundation, Surfrider San Diego Chapter, and ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability.<br /><br />“Our shoreline greatly contributes to our economy and our livelihood, and it houses important habitat for a variety of plants and animals,” says Jen Kovecses, staff scientist for San Diego Coastkeeper.  “These king tides give us a rare chance to visualize how gravely sea level rise will change our shoreline. One common sense solution is to restore and protect wetlands, which function like natural sponges, buffering against rising sea levels, higher tides, and increased storm and wave activity.”<br /><br />According to The San Diego Foundation’s Regional Focus 2050 Study, which included contributions from more than 40 multi-disciplinary experts from regional universities, local governments, public sector agencies, nonprofits, and private sector organizations, increases in sea level in San Diego could be 12 – 18 inches by 2050. The king tide event on February 17 is predicted to raise water levels five to eight inches above normal, providing a glimpse of San Diego’s future.  <br /><br />To help document the potential impacts of rising sea levels, local groups are calling on residents to submit photos taken during high tides of areas known to flood and areas where high water levels can be gauged against sea walls, jetties, bridge supports, or dikes. The photos—especially before and after shots-- will help to identify and catalog coastal areas vulnerable to tidal inundation and to promote awareness of the potential impacts of sea level rise.<br /> NOAA’s Tidal Charts showcase the precise locations and tide predictions (http://www.co-ops.nos.noaa.gov/tides11/tab2wc1a.html#122) for the high tides expected February 16 – 18. Residents are encouraged to get out their cameras each morning and help capture sea level rise impacts by submitting photos, along with their contact information, photo location, orientation, and date and time of day, directly to the San Diego King Tide page at http://www.flickr.com/groups/sandiegokingtides/. <br /><br /><br />Locations in San Diego will focus on San Diego Bay and include spots throughout the county. San Diego’s key areas to capture the king tides are in San Diego Bay, Oceanside Beach, San Elijo Lagoon, Del Mar Dog Beach/San Dieguito Lagoon Entrance, Torrey Pines (at the beach strand where Penasquitos enters the ocean), La Jolla Shores, and Mission Beach. <br /><br />Media can arrange a personal tour from shore or on boat and get more information by contacting Kristen Goodrich (kgoodrich@parks.ca.gov, 619-575-3613 x314) at TRNERR or Jen Kovecses (jenlk@localhost/sdcoastkeeper, 619-758-7743 x113) at San Diego Coastkeeper. Residents can learn more about the king tides and the photography submission guidelines by visiting the Flickr site: http://www.flickr.com/groups/sandiegokingtides/. <br /><br />###<br /><br />About National Estuarine Research Reserve System The National Estuarine Research Reserve System (NERRS) is a network of protected areas established for long-term research, education, and stewardship.  Through a partnership between the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Estuarine Reserves Division and the coastal states, the NERRS plays a critical role in sustaining the nation’s estuaries and coastal communities.  There are currently 28 Reserves located throughout the United States, comprising more than one million acres of estuarine land and water.  Reserves conduct research, monitoring, restoration, education, and training designed to improve our understanding and management of estuaries. For more information, visit www.trnerr.org<br /><br />About San Diego Coastkeeper<br /> Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects the region’s inland and coastal waters for the communities and wildlife that depend on them by blending education, community empowerment, and advocacy.

These underwater state parks will provide critically needed protections for <st1:city w:st="on">San Diego</st1:city> coastal hot spots like south <st1:place w:st="on">La Jolla</st1:place> and Swamis in Encinitas.  </p> <p>Several recent studies underscore the urgent need for a comprehensive marine protected area system, like the one <st1:state w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">California</st1:place></st1:state> is creating through the Marine Life Protection Act (MLPA), to buffer against growing threats like climate change, habitat loss and fishing pressure.  A <a href="http://www.iucn.org/knowledge/news/?7695/Multiple-ocean-stresses-threaten-globally-significant-marine-extinction">report</a> to the United Nations warned of potential mass extinctions within our lifetimes if preventative action is not taken, and identified marine protected areas as a key solution.  A <a href="http://www.mpa.gov/pdf/helpful-resources/factsheets/us_marinereserves.pdf">NOAA study</a> emphasized the benefits marine protected areas provide for people. </p> <p>“These science-based marine protected areas will help replenish <st1:placetype w:st="on">San Diego</st1:placetype>’s coastal ecosystems so that marine life and habitats can recover and thrive,” says Gabriel Solmer, Coastkeeper’s Interim Executive Director. </p> <p>“Thousands of south coast residents participated in the planning process for these marine protected areas, and dozens of community efforts are already underway to support education, research and outreach needs,” said Karen Garrison of Natural Resources Defense Council. </p> <p>The new marine protected areas were planned by local stakeholders, including members of Coastkeeper staff, during a two-year public process that spanned more than 50 public meetings and generated tens of thousands of community emails. The network was designed to protect sea life and habitats at biodiversity hot spots while leaving nearly 90 percent of the coast open for fishing (see a <a href="http://caloceans.org/document/fishing-areas-left-open-under-socal-ipa.pdf.">map of fishing areas left open</a>).  The new protected areas will improve access for recreation, study and education while boosting the overall health of <st1:placetype w:st="on">California</st1:placetype>’s ocean. </p> <p>On December 15, 2010, the California Fish &amp; Game Commission voted in favor of adopting marine protected areas in southern <st1:placetype w:st="on">California</st1:placetype>. <st1:placetype w:st="on">San Diego</st1:placetype>’s new marine protected areas include a fully protected marine reserve at south La Jolla, and conservation areas at Swamis in Encinitas, <st1:placetype w:st="on"><st1:placetype w:st="on">La Jolla</st1:placetype> <st1:placetype w:st="on">Shores</st1:placetype></st1:placetype> and the Tijuana River Mouth. </p> <p>For more information about marine protected areas, visit Coastkeeper’s website at <a href="http://localhost/sdcoastkeeper/">localhost/sdcoastkeeper</a>.</p> <p align="center">###</p> <p>Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects the region’s inland and coastal waters for the communities and wildlife that depend on them by blending education, community empowerment and advocacy.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Broad-based affiliation sees need to explore safe, reliable options for drinking water in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">San Diego</st1:city></st1:place></em></p> <p style="text-align: left;"><st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"></st1:place></st1:city></p>  <!--more-->  <p>San Diego, Calif. – Thursday, June 30, 2011 –The Water Reliability Coalition, a broad-based affiliation of environmental, consumer, business, labor, development, taxpayer and technical organizations, supports the City of San Diego’s pilot project to explore the purification of wastewater into drinking water.  </p> <p>Today, City of <st1:place w:st="on">San Diego Mayor Jerry Sanders</st1:place> announced the kick-off of the year-long testing period, which will examine the feasibility of treating wastewater to drinking water standards for the City of <st1:place w:st="on">San Diego</st1:place>. </p> <p>“A stable, dependable supply of water is critical for <st1:place w:st="on">San Diego</st1:place>’s growing community,” said co-chair Lani Lutar of the San Diego County Taxpayers Association. “The coalition members support investment in the water purification pilot project because it is anticipated to result in a local, drought-proof water supply source that will help decrease the city’s reliance on expensive, imported water.” </p> <p>To perform the pilot study, the city built a test facility at the North City Water Reclamation Plant, where the city purifies wastewater into so-called “reclaimed” water that can be used for industrial landscaping and other non-drinking purposes. The new facility will purify this water even further, so clean it could be safe enough to drink. Currently, the facility will pump the finished product back into the reclaimed water system for industrial use. This year-long testing of one million gallons a day will provide scientific data that will help determine whether the process is clean and safe. </p> <p>If the results of the pilot project gain approval from the California Department of Public Health, then <st1:place w:st="on">San Diego</st1:place>’s leadership will vote whether to pursue wastewater recycling as a means to augment <st1:place w:st="on">San Diego</st1:place>’s water supply.  If they vote in favor of wastewater recycling, then the project will enter into the next phase, which includes building a full-scale Advanced Water Purification Facility adjacent to the North City Water Reclamation Plant. Additionally, the City would build a 23-mile pipeline to transport the highly purified water to the San Vicente Reservoir, where the water would blend with <st1:place w:st="on">San Diego</st1:place>’s alternate sources of water and then get treated once again before reaching the homes of <st1:place w:st="on">San Diego</st1:place>. </p> <p>“We’re not the first city to explore this safe water supply option,” said co-chair Ms. <st1:place w:st="on">Gabriel Solmer</st1:place> of San Diego Coastkeeper. “In fact, in Southern California, the Irvine Ranch Water District has distributed recycled water for over thirty years and <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Orange</st1:place> <st1:place w:st="on">County</st1:place></st1:place> has added highly purified recycled wastewater to groundwater supplies that residents use as a source of drinking water. This technology is used around the world.” </p> <p>The Coalition believes that recycling water for potable use can be an important part of <st1:place w:st="on">San Diego</st1:place>’s water supply portfolio diversification. In the <st1:place w:st="on">San Diego</st1:place> region, potable reuse could provide one of the most cost-effective and environmentally friendly options to enhance local water supplies.</p> <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">### <o:p> </o:p></span></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The Water Reliability Coalition is a broad-based affiliation of environmental, consumer, business, labor, development, taxpayer and technical organizations that have come together to support exploration of Indirect Potable Reuse as a potential strategy to develop a safe, reliable, sustainable &amp; cost-effective local water supply. <o:p> <br /></o:p></span></span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;"><br />Coalition members include: BIOCOM; Building Industry Association; Building Owners and Managers Association, San Diego Chapter; Citizens Coordinate for Century 3; Coastal Environmental Rights Foundation; Empower San Diego; Endangered Habitats League; Environmental Health Coalition; Friends of Infrastructure; Industrial Environmental Association; National Association of Industrial and Office Properties, San Diego Chapter;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>San Diego and Imperial Counties Labor Council; San Diego Audubon Society; San Diego Regional Economic Development Corporation; San Diego Coastkeeper; San Diego County Taxpayers Association; San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce; San Diego River Park Foundation; Surfrider Foundation, San Diego Chapter; Sustainability Alliance of Southern California; Utility Consumers' Action Network</span> </span></span></p>]]></content:encoded>

The Coalition has raised close to $15,000 from local businesses and government agencies to support the purchase and placement of 110 temporary trash and 90 recycle bins for the Independence Day and Labor Day holidays. Look for these temporary cardboard bins on the sand in the areas of Ocean Beach, Mission Beach, Mission Bay Park, and Pacific Beach.</p> <p>This year the Clean Beach Coalition encourages awareness about individuals’ ability to reduce their waste.  Each person has the capacity to anticipate the trash they will create in their day and act prudently to prevent that trash from ending up on the beach and in the ocean.  The CBC has provided a list of suggestions for what to bring to the beach as well as what not to bring, in order to make it easier to enjoy the holiday without the guilt and mess of trash littering the coastline.  Based on combined beach cleanup data, the CBC advises to avoid Styrofoam, single use plastics cups/bottles, and heavily plastic-packaged goods.  The CBC also suggests that beachgoers bring reusable bottles that can be refilled at water fountains, pack lunch in Tupperware within a durable, reusable cooler, and if you need a trash bag, borrow one from a less eco-minded neighbor who packed their party in plastic.  It’s important to spread the knowledge about why your patriotic celebration is plastic-free; this step is a worthy investment in the future of local environment. While the Coalition’s focus is on preventing the mess, it also sponsors the annual July 5 “Morning After Mess” cleanup. See http://sandiego.surfrider.org/the-morning-after-mess for details and to find out how to help.</p> <p>The Clean Beach Coalition, which consists of local environmental organizations, community groups, and government agencies, has come together for the fourth consecutive year to raise awareness of and prevent beach litter issues. CBC member agencies include: FreePB.org, I Love A Clean San Diego, San Diego Coastkeeper, the San Diego Chapter of Surfrider Foundation as well as the City of San Diego Parks &amp; Recreation Department. T<span style="font-size: 12pt;">his year’s efforts would not be pos</span>sible without the support of generous sponsors, including title sponsor Pacific Beach Shore Club and others including Woodstock’s Pizza, Lahaina Beach House, Verant Group, Allied Waste Services, Mission Beach Town Council, SDG&amp;E, Vavi Sport and Social Club, Mission Beach Woman’s Club, City of San Diego District 2 and San Diego Coaster Company. More information about the San Diego Clean Beach Coalition is available at www.cleanbeachcoalition.org.</p> <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The San Diego Clean Beach Coalition is a collaboration of local non-profit organizations and city agencies focused on coastal stewardship, raising awareness of beach litter issues, and preventing marine debris.</span><br /><br />###</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Career environmental prosecutor Gale Filter joins water watchdog group on July 18</p> <p>{readmorelink}Read the full article{/readmorelink}</p>  <!--more-->  <p>SAN DIEGO (July 11, 2011) - San Diego Coastkeeper announced today its new executive director, Gale Filter, who will join the organization on July 18. Filter comes to San Diego from his role as deputy director of enforcement and emergency response for the California Environmental Protection Agency’s Department of Toxic Substances Control. Filter’s previous work experience includes time as the deputy executive director for consumer, environmental and legal services at the California District Attorney’s Association, as a deputy district attorney in Imperial County and as an instructor at Joliet Junior College.<br /><br />“Enforcing the law is at the heart of every Waterkeeper organization, and Gale has built his professional career on this notion,” said San Diego Coastkeeper Board President David Welborn. “He brings to San Diego Coastkeeper a long history of success in environmental leadership and enforcement perfectly paired with a commitment to education and collaboration.”<br /><br />While at the Department of Toxic Substances Control, Filter worked to ensure that businesses and others followed state laws and regulations in how they managed, stored and transported hazardous waste in California. Working with an annual budget of approximately $20 million, he directed all aspects of the enforcement program including a staff of 150 scientists, inspectors and criminal investigators at eight state offices.</p> <p>“Enforcement is powerful, but the power of collaboration should not be overlooked. In many cases, I’ve found that we can achieve compliance if the parties involved possess a collective will to address and fix the environmental problem,” said Filter. “We have much to gain from working together to improve the health of our environment. Enforcement is only part of the solution.”</p> <p>When hired at the Department of Toxic Substances, Filter was tasked to modernize the environmental enforcement program into a transparent, accountable and efficient program that maximized reduction of environmental harms in the state. The Environmental Protection Agency considers his reorganized and modernized environmental enforcement program as one of its five “showcase models” that brought improvements in public health and the environment.</p> <p>He also created the Environmental Justice Enforcement Initiative, a community-based policing and task force program that focuses on collecting intelligence and “spotting and squishing” environmental harms.  The Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government honored this initiative as a 2010 Bright Idea in American Government.<br /><br />“The future of environmental protection and enforcement is in agile, dynamic and creative groups like San Diego Coastkeeper,” said Filter. “As our city and state governments struggle with budgets, the people of this region will depend on our efforts to ensure that San Diego’s inland and coastal waters remain clean.”<br /><br />From 1999 to 2003, Filter was the environmental project director for the California District Attorneys Association. And before joining the Toxic Substances Control department of the state, he served as the deputy executive director of consumer, environmental and legal services at the District Attorneys Association.<br /><br />A lifelong environmentalist, Filter started his official environmental work in California in 1991 when he was a prosecutor in the Imperial County District Attorney’s office. Along with prosecuting murder and serious felony cases, Filter took on environmental crimes and prosecuted people responsible for harming the environment.<br /><br />Gale has a Juris Doctorate degree from the University Of San Diego School of Law, a Master of Public Administration degree from Governors State University in Illinois and a Bachelor of Arts degree from Humboldt State University.</p> <p>Interim Executive Director Gabriel Solmer, who stepped into the position in late 2010 to guide the organization through its transition, will continue her role as legal director, leading the organization’s Environmental Law &amp; Policy Clinic. <br /><br />###<br /><br />Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects the region’s inland and coastal waters for the communities and wildlife that depend on them by blending education, community empowerment and advocacy.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Environmental science lessons teach students about water quality, pollution prevention</p> <p></p>  <!--more-->  <p>SAN DIEGO, CA – San Diego Coastkeeper and the City of San Diego launched the Project SWELL 1st grade curriculum in San Diego Unified School District (SDUSD) this morning at Audubon K-8School. San Diego City Council President Tony Young, SDUSD Board of Education President Richard Barrera and San Diego Coastkeeper Interim Executive Director Gabe Solmer joined 1st grade teacher Jane Sanchez as she led students in a Project SWELL demonstration called “Habitat Match”, where students match wildlife to the appropriate local aquatic environment(s), including wetlands, kelp forest, and tide pools. <br /><br />Project SWELL (Stewardship: Water Education for Lifelong Leadership) promotes awareness of clean water and pollution prevention and fosters a sense of environmental stewardship in children. The City of San Diego and San Diego Coastkeeper have united with SDUSD to enhance the existing science curriculum with hands-on science lessons to teach students about pollution prevention in their local environment. This unique education program aligns with the State Science Content Standards and is adapted to teach students about San Diego issues, engaging youth in improving the health of our local waterways. <br /><br />“The environment and economy go hand in hand,” said San Diego City Council President Tony Young.  “We need to invest in our future through education and expansion of the green job sector.  Project SWELL is a great start in the education and training of the next generation of environmentally aware citizens and skilled green workers needed to achieve our city’s environmental and economic goals.”<br /><br />This innovative approach to learning began with the inaugural rollout of the 5th grade lessons in 2004. Since then, project partners have developed and implemented lessons for Kindergarten, 2nd, 4th and 6th grades in SDUSD and 5th grade classrooms in Oceanside Unified School District. Since its inception, Project SWELL has reached 180,000 students. The lessons provide a tremendous benefit for a wide range of stakeholders throughout San Diego, including teachers and students, the City of San Diego and San Diego’s coastal environment. <br /><br />With the development of the 1st grade lessons, Project SWELL will reach more than 60,000 children annually. Ultimately, project partners plan to develop Project SWELL in all K-12 classrooms in SDUSD and continue to expand the program into other school districts countywide. Coastkeeper also plans to expand teacher training and availability of lessons online for busy teachers in SDUSD.  <br /><br />Project SWELL is made possible thanks to generous support from Coastkeeper’s partners and sponsors: City of San Diego Stormwater Department - Think Blue, San Diego Unified School District, Sempra Energy Foundation, Qualcomm Incorporated, Hunter Industries, Catherine Steifel and John K Behner, PIMCO Foundation, McCarthy Family Foundation, San Diego County Regional Airport Authority, Hervey Family Non-endowment Fund at the San Diego Foundation, Price Charities, The Hattie Ettinger Conservation Fund at The San Diego Foundation, The Heller Foundation of San Diego, Wells Fargo Foundation and The San Diego Foundation’s Anonymous Fund.<br /><br />For more information on Project SWELL and its partners, visit its newly launched website at <a href="http://www.ProjectSWELL.org">www.ProjectSWELL.org</a>.</p> <p>#    #    #  <br /><br />Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects the region’s bays, beaches, watersheds and ocean for the people and wildlife that depend on them. We balance community outreach, education, and advocacy to promote stewardship of clean water and a healthy coastal ecosystem. </p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>July 14 - Kona Brewing&#039;s Liquid Aloha Festival Raises More Than $18,000 for San Diego Coastkeeper</title>
		<link>http://localhost/demodata/?p=62</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>  <!--more-->  <p>Kailua-Kona, Big Island of Hawaii, July 14, 2011 — Last weekend’s Liquid Aloha Festival, brought to San Diego by Kona Brewing Company, raised $ 18,221 in gross proceeds for San Diego Coastkeeper. The event took place at NTC Promenade in the Point Loma area of San Diego, where thousands enjoyed 5 live bands including The Dirty Heads, Kalama Brothers and DJ Cory Biggs. The next Liquid Aloha Festival is set for July 23 in Newport Beach, CA.<br /><br />Kona Brewing is Hawaii’s largest brewer and San Diego Coastkeeper is the city’s largest professional environmental organization working to protect inland and coastal waters along the Pacific Ocean through education, community empowerment and advocacy. The partnership between Kona Brewing and San Diego Coastkeeper began late 2010. Since then, Kona Brewing has provided monetary support to fund ongoing Coastkeeper programs and beach cleanups, as well as beer for various Coastkeeper events. Coastkeeper will use the funds raised at Liquid Aloha Festival to monitor inland water quality to identify and stop pollution sources before they enter the ocean. Urban runoff is one of the biggest threats to water quality in San Diego, especially after rainstorms when the county issues advisories to surfers and other water recreationalists. <br /><br />The funds will also help the organization with its efforts to increase implementation of low impact development, which captures polluted runoff before it harms local waters. Coastkeeper encourages more educational outreach to residents, so that San Diegans can all make small changes in their daily habits to lessen their impacts on water quality in the region. <br /><br />The investment in clean water is in line with Kona Brewing’s support of environmental causes. “Living and working in Hawaii provides a constant reminder of how fortunate we are to be surrounded by water, yet also how much respect we need to have for it,” said Kona president Mattson Davis. “All of the water used to brew beer in Kona is Hawaii County water, naturally percolated through the porous lava rock that makes up the island. Hawaii County water is hard and high in calcium and chloride, and fortunately, these characteristics are great for making beer.”<br /><br />At Kona’s brewery in Kailua-Kona, a whiskey barrel run off system is situated in the pub’s center. This barrel collects more than 90 gallons of condensation per day from air conditioning systems, and the water is used for landscaping irrigation. <br /><br />Kona’s largest fundraiser is the annual Kona Brewers Festival. Its purpose is to bring awareness to beer, food, and the environment. In 2011, the event site at King Kamehameha hotel was damaged by a tsunami the night before and the event was moved to Kona Brewing headquarters. In light of the disaster, public outpouring was a record $65,000, which went to support 12 local nonprofit organizations. An additional $5,000 was donated to Habitat for Humanity for Big Island tsunami relief efforts.<br /><br />Kona Brewing Company was started in the spring of 1994 by father and son team Cameron Healy and Spoon Khalsa, who had a dream to create fresh, local island brews made with spirit, passion and quality. It is a Hawaii-born and Hawaii-based craft brewery that prides itself on brewing the freshest beer of exceptional quality, closest to market. This helps to minimize its carbon footprint by reducing shipping of raw materials, finished beer and wasteful packaging materials. The brewery is headquartered where it began, in Kailua-Kona on Hawaii’s Big Island. It has grown into Hawaii’s largest brewery, has three restaurant sites in Hawaii and beer distribution reaching 29 states and Japan. It is the 13th largest craft brewery in the country. For more information call 808-334-BREW or www.KonaBrewingCo.com.<br /><br />Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects the region’s inland and coastal waters for the communities and wildlife that depend on them by blending education, community empowerment and advocacy.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Statewide survey shows volunteer event provides essential education on marine debris impacts</em></p> <p></p>  <!--more-->  <div> <p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 11.0px Calibri; min-height: 13.0px;"><strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>San Diego, Calif.</strong> – Registration is now open for San Diego County’s largest environmental volunteer event, Coastal Cleanup Day. San Diego coordinators <a href="http://www.ilacsd.org/">I Love a Clean San Diego</a> and <a href="undefined/">San Diego Coastkeeper</a> expect about 10,000 volunteers to participate in the 27th Annual California Coastal Cleanup Day in San Diego County on Saturday, Sept. 17. Coordinators will host more than 85 inland and coastal cleanup sites and ask volunteers to bring their own buckets, work gloves and reusable water bottles to help reduce the amount of trash created during the event.</p> <p>According to a survey conducted by the California Coastal Commission, Coastal Cleanup Day effectively improves volunteers’ knowledge of the environmental problems caused by marine debris. The survey data, taken by participants of the 2010 event in San Diego County, reflect a 23 percent increase in knowledge regarding the causes of marine debris. After the event, more than 82 percent of San Diego respondents consider themselves either “knowledgeable” or “very knowledgeable” about the causes of marine debris, as opposed to only 59 percent before the event. Similarly, after the event, 72 percent of San Diego survey participants considered themselves “knowledgeable” or “very knowledgeable” about the negative environmental impacts caused by marine debris, as opposed to 53 percent before the event.</p> <p>Last year in San Diego County, volunteer involvement rose to approximately 9,000 participants, with another 3,000 volunteers lending their support across the border in the U.S./Mexico-shared Tijuana Watershed. Volunteers removed close to 100 tons of debris from more than 80 cleanup sites along the coastline and in canyons, creek beds, lagoons, estuaries and open spaces.</p> <p>Volunteers can now register for Coastal Cleanup Day, the largest volunteer event in the state, on the official San Diego County Coastal Cleanup Day website, <a href="http://www.cleanupday.org">www.cleanupday.org</a>. The website includes an interactive Google Map with all cleanup sites in the region, including a handful of Green “in need” sites. Event coordinators encourage volunteers to register for a Green “in need” location, as trends in the data show that volunteers recover more trash at select inland sites, thus increasing the need for volunteers there.</p> <p align="center">###</p> <p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CALIFORNIA COASTAL CLEANUP DAY</span></em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><em>is a volunteer event 27 years in the making, with more communities, cities and counties joining every year. Through a partnership with California Coastal Commission and Ocean Conservancy, volunteers track types of debris found to compile and learn the sources of marine debris worldwide. I Love A Clean San Diego and San Diego Coastkeeper co-coordinate this event in San Diego County. More details about each organization can be found online at <a href="http://www.cleansd.org/">www.cleansd.org</a> and <a href="http://localhost/sdcoastkeeper/">localhost/sdcoastkeeper</a>.</em></p> </div>]]></content:encoded>

In addition to Coastkeeper’s data showing high levels of fecal indicator bacteria, ammonia and phosphorous, volunteers noted grey-colored water, a strong sewage odor and a fish kill in the lagoon. According to Coastkeeper, all of the information gathered indicates the severity of environmental and human health repercussions from raw sewage entering into public waters and the growing importance of its volunteer-run monitoring efforts. Without Coastkeeper’s efforts, the effects would have remained unnoticed to regulators, leaving residents unaware. <a href="blog/urban-runoff/item/170-when-the-lights-go-down-in-the-city-and-the-sewage-flows-into-lagoon.html">Actual data graphs and photographs</a> are available on Coastkeeper’s blog.<br /><br />Thursday’s loss of power for many parts of the Southwest caused three major sewage spills in the San Diego and Baja region. In addition to the North County incident, about 120,000 gallons spilled into the Sweetwater River from a pump station near Interstate 5 and state Route 54 and an even larger spill south of the Mexican border, where Baja California authorities reported a pump station lost power and sent 3.8 million gallons of sewage into the Tijuana River. These spills come nearly two weeks after a 250,000-gallon spill into the San Elijo Lagoon. Authorities reported loss of power as the reason for all four sewage spills.<br /><br />In the September 9 San Diego Union-Tribune article about the recent spills, City of San Diego officials stated they run 84 sewage pump stations and have backup diesel generators “where it is financially and spatially feasible.” According to the article, “city officials assessed the possibility of putting on-site power at those sites a few years ago, but decided it was too costly and there wasn’t enough room for the machines.”<br /><br />“City and state agencies are wagering human and environmental health against the odds of another emergency,” said San Diego Coastkeeper’s Executive Director Gale Filter. “They are gambling that some sewage pump stations aren’t worth the investment of a proper emergency backup—is one of these raw sewage pump stations in your neighborhood?”<br /><br />The water quality samples collected by Coastkeeper volunteers show a trend of higher-than-normal concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria and nutrients and very low concentrations of oxygen dissolved in the water.  <br /><br />“Bacterial concentrations were at least 600 times higher than safe thresholds allow. It was higher than our test equipment can measure,” said San Diego Coastkeeper Lab Coordinator Travis Pritchard. “All data point towards sewage contamination—the reduced oxygen level suffocated fish and the high bacteria levels endangers human health.” <br /> <br />According to Saturday’s results:<br /><br />•    Bacterial concentrations exceeded the maximum level Coastkeeper’s test can detect at 241,920 E. coli/100ml. The maximum limit for healthy human contact is 406 E. coli/100ml. <br />•    Nutrient concentrations, a strong indicator of sewage in water, showed the same pattern as bacteria. Ammonia concentrations exceeded 2 mg/L, far above the 0.025 mg/L maximum limit for healthy streams. Phosphorus concentrations exceeded 1.5 mg/L, above the 0.1 mg/L concentration limit for healthy streams.<br />•    Dissolved oxygen concentration, perhaps the most important measurement for health of aquatic wildlife, was almost zero (0.08 mg/L), far below the 5.0 mg/L aquatic organisms need to survive. This resulted in the suffocation of fish in that section of the stream.<br /><br />“Coastkeeper’s volunteers have monitored this site for more than two years now, giving us historical data for comparison,” said Pritchard. “Los Penasquitos is typically one of our top three most healthy watersheds in the county. This is the worst water quality we’ve ever seen here.”<br /><br />San Diego Coastkeeper, the environmental watchdog for water issues in San Diego, already reported the fish kill to California Department of Fish &amp; Game. Coastkeeper is currently evaluating its next steps to hold local and state agencies accountable for damage caused by the recent sewage spills and ensure they properly prepare the region for another emergency. <br /><br />“Why would we need a cost and benefit analysis when human and environmental health are on the line?” said Filter. “To justify Thursday’s black out as a “once-in-a-generation” issue blindly ignores the Cardiff spill two weeks ago and downplays the risk of significant earthquakes and brownouts in our region that could easily cause similar sewage spills.”<br /><br /><br /># # #<br />San Diego Coastkeeper<br />Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects the region’s bays, beaches, watersheds and ocean for the people and wildlife that depend on them.  We balance community outreach, education, and advocacy to promote stewardship of clean water and a healthy coastal ecosystem.<em><br /></em></div>]]></content:encoded>

This team of highly trained volunteers will scour San Diego County seeking sources of pollution that contribute to urban runoff. Commonly cited as the number one threat to water quality in San Diego, urban runoff contains pollutants such as oil, grease, pesticides, metals, bacteria, viruses and toxic chemicals that wash into the region’s waters during rainstorms and over irrigation.</p> <div></div> <p>When residents join Pollution Patrollers, San Diego Coastkeeper trains them about the federal Clean Water Act and how its permitting process requires every city in San Diego County to ensure municipal, commercial, industrial and residential sites minimize urban runoff pollution. Volunteers will use their training to inspect various sites throughout the county to ensure that the cities meet their permit guidelines. Coastkeeper’s Environmental Law &amp; Policy Clinic plans to use the patroller-gathered data to identify problem areas around the county and to assist local cities to change practices that lead to urban runoff pollution.</p> <div></div> <p>“Pollution Patrollers gets right at the heart of what San Diego Coastkeeper stands for: empowering citizens to enforce the Clean Water Act here in San Diego,” said Dylan Edwards, San Diego’s Coastkeeper’s Volunteer Coordinator. “With recent slashing of government budgets statewide, it’s more important than ever that volunteers help supplement the fight against urban runoff.”</p> <div></div> <p>In addition to scheduled inspections of sites coordinated by San Diego Coastkeeper, Pollution Patrollers volunteers will have the knowledge to identify pollution “hot spots” in their own neighborhoods so that San Diego Coastkeeper can help find solutions to stop the pollution at the source.</p> <div></div> <p>The next Pollution Patrollers volunteer training will take place on September 20 from 6 p.m. -8 p.m. and the next formal patrol will take place on October 1. New volunteers must RSVP by contacting Dylan Edwards at (619) 758-7743 x131 or dylan@localhost/sdcoastkeeper. Volunteers must attend a Pollution Patrollers training in order to participate in the formalized inspections.</p> <div></div> <p style="text-align: center;">###</p> <div><em>Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects the region’s inland and coastal waters for the communities and wildlife that depend on them by blending education, community empowerment and advocacy.

When the concept of scarcity pricing is introduced to communities, whereby households are charged at higher volumetric rates as supplies decline, it leads to massive water conservation.  This not only saves communities capital costs on water infrastructure, but during times of non-drought, water supplies are cheaper for the general public.  This is the antithesis of San Diego’s existing pricing structure and resulting water waste in place now.</p> <p>Dr. Zetland will give a brief overview on our current water pricing structure, and introduce his cutting-edge ideas.  The presentation will be followed by a question and answer session.  The “Three Easy Steps to Sustainable Water Management in Southern California” forum is sponsored by UCan, Middle Class Taxpayers Association, Surfrider Foundation, San Diego Chapter, San Diego Coastkeeper, CERF and Sierra Club.</p> <div></div> <p style="text-align: center;">###</p> <div></div> <div style="font-style: italic;"></div> </div>]]></content:encoded>

Coastkeeper staff will present this information to the Natural Resource &amp; Culture Committee of the San Diego City Council on Wednesday, Sept. 28, as part of the report from the Public Utilities Department regarding power outage impacts. At the meeting, Coastkeeper's lawyers will ask the City to take meaningful timely action to ensure effective investigation, cleanup and prevention.</p> <p>“Now is the time for the city to rectify its mistakes handling this sewage crisis and take the proper steps to ensure it won't happen again,” said Gabriel Solmer, Coastkeeper’s advocacy director,  “Our human and environmental health and economy depend on the city taking discrete and proactive action.”</p> <p>Coastkeeper volunteers were the first to discover and report harmful impacts in the Los Penasquitos Lagoon following the 1.9-million gallon sewage spill from the Roselle Street pumping station. While Coastkeeper’s sampling data revealed high levels of fecal indicator bacteria, ammonia and phosphorous, volunteers saw grey-colored water, smelled a strong sewage odor and spotted a number of dead fish in the lagoon. Data graphs and photographs are available on <a target="_blank" href="blog/sick-of-sewage.html">Coastkeeper’s blog</a>.</p> <p>Due to the reporting efforts of Coastkeeper’s first responders, City and Regional Water Quality Control Board staff eventually set up mitigation efforts to remove sewage from the creek. City crews arrived on scene four days after the spill. As of Friday, the City had completed pumping efforts after comparing the background levels of sewage to Coastkeeper’s monitoring data at the pumping site. However, dissolved oxygen remained low downstream of the spill. Bacteria and ammonia levels remained above state standards when last checked on September 20.</p> <p>In a written report to the City committee, <a target="_blank" href="http://docs.sandiego.gov/councilcomm_agendas_attach/2011/NRC_110928_7a.pdf">City Public Works staff explained the impact of the blackout and the cause of the spill</a>. As part of the report, staff committed to coordination with state and local agencies for ongoing cleanup efforts. Given the cause of the spill, the staff also pledged to study options for back-up on-site power generation, although with no given timeframe.</p> <p>Coastkeeper’s Solmer appreciated the switch in thinking. “This spill, when coupled with other recent events in San Onofre, Del Mar, Cardiff, San Diego Bay and Tijuana, shows a disturbing increasing trend in the region,” she said.  “We were happy to stand with the mayor just last year and tout a decade of decreasing spills in San Diego. With those numbers now on the rise, now is not the time to turn our backs on this issue. Now is the time for the City of San Diego to be a leader.”</p> <p>The City’s Natural Resource &amp; Culture Committee meeting is Wednesday, Sept. 28 at City Hall.  The meeting is open to the public. The Committee will take testimony on the spill during <a target="_blank" href="http://docs.sandiego.gov/ccagenda_nrc/n110928.pdf">agenda item 7</a>.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"># # #</p> <p>Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects the region’s bays, beaches, watersheds and ocean for the people and wildlife that depend on them.  We balance community outreach, education, and advocacy to promote stewardship of clean water and a healthy coastal ecosystem.</p> <p> </p> <div></div> <div style="font-style: italic;"></div> </div>]]></content:encoded>

Even though the community will miss the closing non-profit, local environmental organizations remind that opportunities are still available.</p> <p>San Diego Coastkeeper, San Diego River Park Foundation and Project Wildlife came together to announce that while they will feel the loss of the valuable volunteer recruitment service, they still have many volunteer needs. All three organizations will increase their volunteer opportunities for community members to help them find meaningful projects as well as create chances to fill community service requirements.</p> <p>“Volunteer San Diego played a major role connecting our needs with volunteer resources in the community and we’re all saddened to see the organization close,” said Dylan Edwards, volunteer coordinator of San Diego Coastkeeper, “There’s no doubt that our local environment can continue to benefit from volunteer service and I’m proud of this group of environmental non-profits coming together to connect people to our community’s needs.”</p> <p>San Diego Coastkeeper has opportunities for volunteers in a variety of its programs including beach cleanups, Water Quality Monitoring, Pollution Patrollers and community education.  Volunteers can visit localhost/sdcoastkeeper for more information.</p> <p>The San Diego River Park Foundation has opportunities for volunteers in helping create and care for parks, river clean-ups, nature education and more. A list of current opportunities can be found at www.sandiegoriver.org.</p> <p>Project Wildlife is always looking for volunteers to help care for wildlife patients, answer hotline calls, educate the public on wildlife issues and provide administrative support.

The website can be found at http://localhost/sdcoastkeeper/learn/san-diegos-waters/sea-level-rise.html. The interactive tool displays possible habitat impacts in the year of 2100 at Tijuana River Estuary, San Diego Bay and Mission Bay for sea level rise of 0.4 meters, 1.5 meters and 2 meters.</p> <p>To help the region prepare for the changes, Dr. Rick Gersberg from the Graduate School of Public Health at San Diego State University and San Diego Coastkeeper partnered to inform the public of the resource.</p> <p>“Government officials, coastal planners and local residents need the best available data and information to better prepare our region for potential impacts,” said San Diego Coastkeeper Staff Scientist, Jen Kovecses. “These local data can help reduce some of the associated uncertainty that our decision makers and planners face.”</p> <p>In making the maps, Dr. Gersberg’s lab gathered coastal data for the San Diego coast and integrated it into an Environmental Protection Agency model called Sea Level Affects Marshes Model (SLAMM). The outcome of that model consists of predicted scenarios showing how ten of San Diego’s coastal habitats might shift as sea levels change. Using different sea level rise scenarios (essentially low, moderate, high sea level rise), the model predicts that San Diego’s coastal habitats may look very different over the next 100 years.</p> <p>“Our model shows that by 2100, San Diego’s coastline may lose 35 to 43 percent of its ocean beaches, 23 percent of its inland freshwater marshes, 42 percent of its tidal freshwater marshes and 51% of its brackish water marshes,” said Gersberg. “These potential changes and the consequences to habitat alteration are severe and something that we need to take into consideration today as we make planning decisions.”</p> <p>Coastkeeper worked with Dr. Gersberg to disseminate the results to local government officials, business people, residents and other interested parties. Ultimately, this information formed part of the foundation for a sea level rise adaptation plan for San Diego Bay.</p> <p>The generous support of the Environment Blasker Grant of the <a href="http://www.sdfoundation.org/GrantsScholarships.aspx" target="_blank">San Diego Foundation</a> made this project possible. The final outcome of Coastkeeper’s partnership with Dr. Gersberg is the interactive map that displays the model results for a subset of coastal areas and key findings from the model analysis. This map will evolve over time as Dr. Gersberg’s lab develops and refines other model results. Consequently, Coastkeeper will update the web page with relevant information.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"># # #</p> <p>Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects the region’s bays, beaches, watersheds and ocean for the people and wildlife that depend on them. We balance community outreach, education, and advocacy to promote stewardship of clean water and a healthy coastal ecosystem.

Since September 2009, Lazootin has volunteered in Coastkeeper’s water quality monitoring program. Today, she is a lead volunteer who oversees all aspects of the two-day water quality sampling and laboratory analysis.</p> <p>“We provide essential water quality data for our county,” said Travis Pritchard, Coastkeeper’s water monitoring lab manager. “Taya is the glue that holds us together.”</p> <p>Lazootin also helps Coastkeeper's marine debris staff run special cleanup events, and she regularly supports all north county beach cleanups.</p> <p>By day, Lazootin trains educators to teach science at the Perris School District. Because of her teacher training background, she also volunteers with Coastkeeper’s Project SWELL. She provides counsel on creative ways to work within school systems and to keep the curriculum updated to meet the needs of today’s technologically advanced classrooms. Lazootin has also helped transform materials for Coastkeeper’s events from environmental activities into formalized educational lessons.</p> <p>Along with Lazootin, Coastkeeper nominated 27 Volunteer Core Hall of Fame and 41 Water Quality Monitoring Hall of Fame volunteers.</p> <p>The Volunteer Core Hall of Fame inductees include: Amanda Sousa, Sierra Basegio, Taya Lazootin, Rebecca Kanter, Kevin Straw, Amy Havens, Bonnie Benitez, Chris Gunst, David Babiarz, Jaime Somers, John Freutel, Karen Wytmans, Kathleen Kelly, Katelyn Hailey, Kelsey Flynn-Granquist, Lili Canellas, Maya Wasserman, Molly Troup, Patty Malecke, Ruby Teague, Tom Bernitt, Tori Baird, Travis Johnson, Victoria Rios, Stephanie Killion and Yana Titova.</p> <p>The Water Quality Monitoring Hall of Fame volunteers are: Adrian Kinnane, Al Barret, Amanda Sousa, Beth Hendershot, Bruce Hendershot, Cathryn Henning, Cynthia Gorham, Debby Knight, Dan Murphy, Frank Kawasaki, Graham Szybala, George Liddle, Jack Marshall, Jim Brown, Kacey Cinciarelli, Karen Waggoner, Rebecca Kanter, Rexanne Dayes, Steve Kwik, Taya Lazootin, Tom Bernitt, Allison Scofield, Ashley Brock, Chris Swanson, Dale Dalrymple, David Babiarz, Elana Colby, Glenda Poliner, Katie Jocelyn, Kelly Gallagher, Lucas Salazar, Melissa Ta, Noah Thoron, Paige Decino, Roderick Michener, Shane Mudd, Shelley Reid, Stephanie Hines, Tara Pelan and Tom Mills.</p> <p>"If you are serious about protecting our environment, come to Coastkeeper," said Erin Reynante, volunteer and outreach coordinator at San Diego Coastkeeper. "We will find you the perfect volunteer project so you can make an impact while having fun."</p> <p>This year, Coastkeeper has coordinated with around 16,000 volunteers who dedicated more than 27,000 hours of service. This is the same as ten full-time employees contributing their time to saving San Diego’s inland and coastal waters.</p> <p>Funding from community partners such as the Hattie Ettinger Conservation Fund at The San Diego Foundation, Patagonia and REI make volunteer training and support possible at San Diego Coastkeeper. The organization offers a variety of volunteer opportunities including beach cleanups, water quality monitoring, community outreach, advocacy, education and its new Pollution Patrollers program.

In conjunction with Sister Schools of San Diego, Coastkeeper hosted the 10th Annual event at Birch Aquarium to help children understand their role in preserving water quality across the world. The event featured environmental and ocean themed educational activities for the school children from San Diego and Tijuana, Mexico, and concluded a student water monitoring program in seven countries.</p> <p>“World Water Monitoring Day allows students to join together and take a hands-on approach to understanding the value of clean water for people, plants and wildlife,” said Liz Hinkle, Director of San Diego Sister Schools.  “Over 500 students in San Diego County and hundreds more around the world will use test kits to monitor water quality in rivers and the ocean near their homes. Students will share their data with others around the world to illustrate the international importance of protecting water quality for which we are all responsible.”</p> <p>During World Water Monitoring Day, students rotated through a number of interactive water education activities including Coastkeeper’s Water Quality Monitoring and Edible Aquifer, I Love A Clean San Diego‘s Watershed Models, San Diego River Park Foundation’s Bioassesment lesson, Birch Aquarium’s Ocean Acidification lesson and the San Diego County Office of Education’s Splash Lab and Green Machine. This year’s event celebrated public stewardship of water quality and conservation, the importance of clean water in the San Diego Region and educating youth on watershed protection and the value of World Water Monitoring Day.</p> <p>“It’s essential to connect children to water quality issues in their backyard and across the globe,” said Erin Reynante, San Diego’s Coastkeeper’s Outreach Coordinator. “With World Water Monitoring Day, we’re helping tomorrow’s leaders understand how they can make a difference in protecting and preserving San Diego’s natural resources now.”</p> <p>The event brings attention to World Water Monitoring Day, which is an international outreach program to build public awareness and involvement in protecting water resources around the world. In addition to the 200 students participating in the event at Birch Aquarium, over 500 students across the county will use test kits to collect and analyze water samples in the coming months. Their water monitoring results will be shared with students around the world who are also participating in water quality monitoring in Japan, Poland, Mexico and Russia.</p> <p style="text-align: center;">###</p> <p>ABOUT SAN DIEGO COASTKEEPER</p> <p>Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects the region’s inland and coastal waters for the communities and wildlife that depend on them by blending education, community empowerment and advocacy.

		<title>January 25 - San Diego Coastkeeper Applauds Sewage Backup Generator Plan Put Forward by City of San Diego Wastewater Officials</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Coastkeeper encourages City Council to approve the infrastructure upgrade to protect the region’s economy, health, environment</em></p>  <!--more-->  <div> <p>SAN DIEGO, CA-January 25, 2011 – San Diego Coastkeeper, the region's environmental watchdog protecting inland and coastal waters, applauds City of San Diego's wastewater officials for its recently unveiled generator backup plan for eight sewage pumps stations in the city. According to a recent Union-Tribune article, the approximately $12-million strategy "relies on leasing temporary backup generators for vulnerable sites in the city's sprawling wastewater system while permanent ones are installed by mid-2013."</p> <p>The plan, which still requires City Council approval, is in response to the estimated 3.7 million gallons of sewage that spilled on Sept. 8, 2011, during a blackout that affected the southwestern United States.</p> <p>"This improved sewage generator backup plan is necessary to protect residents' health, our tourism economy and the environment," said San Diego Coastkeeper Executive Director Gale Filter. "We highly advise the City Council to approve this investment in sewage infrastructure, which they've known for many years is needed."</p> <p>San Diego Coastkeeper volunteers first discovered and reported the harmful impacts to the Los Peñasquitos Lagoon following the 3.5-million gallon sewage spill from the Roselle Street pumping station in September 2011. Due to the reporting and sustained monitoring efforts of Coastkeeper's first responders, City and Regional Water Quality Control Board staff eventually set up mitigation efforts to remove sewage from the lagoon.</p> <p>Coastkeeper presented the data and images to the City Council's Natural Resource &amp; Culture Committee on Sept. 28, 2011, as part of the report from the Public Utilities Department regarding power outage impacts. Then on Oct. 26, 2011, Coastkeeper's executive director also reported on the findings during the Joint Legislative Committee on Emergency Management during a Joint Oversight Hearing at the California State Assembly Committee on Utilities and Commerce.</p> <p>"We're thankful Coastkeeper's volunteers found where the sewage had pooled and alerted our team to take action," said Filter. "It takes a community to protect our waters—we've done our part and now it's time for the City of San Diego to close the loop and protect its residents by installing these backup generators."</p> <p>The loss of power on Sept. 8, 2011, caused three major sewage spills in the San Diego and Baja region in total. In addition to the North County incident, about 200,000 gallons spilled into the Sweetwater River from a pump station near Interstate 5 and state Route 54. And Baja California authorities reported a pump station lost power and sent 3.8-million gallons of sewage into the Tijuana River. These spills came nearly two weeks after a 250,000-gallon sewage spill into the San Elijo Lagoon. Authorities reported loss of power as the reason for all four sewage spills.</p> <p>Learn more about Coastkeeper's <a href="blog/sick-of-sewage/item/220-power-outage-sewage-spill-victory-almost-here.html">efforts during the sewage spill crisis by reading its blog</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #808080;"><em><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></em></span>Wednesday’s final ruling comes after a 20-year-long battle by Coastkeeper, EHC</p> <p></p>  <!--more-->  <div> <p><strong> </strong></p> <div style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 90px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;" id="_mcePaste"><strong>SAN DIEGO, Sept. 6, 2011 – On Saturday, September 17, around 10,000 volunteers will visit 90 coastal and inland cleanup sites for a one-day attack on marine debris and inland pollution. This year, Coastal Cleanup Day coordinators I Love A Clean San Diego and San Diego Coastkeeper highlight on their website several green “in need” cleanup sites, where data from the annual event show a higher demand for volunteers. To reduce the event’s carbon footprint and individual waste, organizers also ask volunteers to select local sites in their own communities and to bring reusable buckets, bags, work gloves and water bottles.</strong></div> <div style="font-weight: bold; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 90px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;" id="_mcePaste">“Trash travels from inland communities into storm drains which empty into our canyons, creek beds and eventually the ocean,” said Pauline Martinson, Executive Director for I Love A Clean San Diego. “That’s why it’s especially important for volunteers to lend a hand in their local neighborhood—our entire county needs a cleaning.”</div> <div style="font-weight: bold; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 90px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;" id="_mcePaste">To encourage participation in areas that need extra hands, San Diego’s Coastal Cleanup Day website, www.cleanupday.org features “in need” sites labeled in green in areas such as Clairemont, Normal Heights, City Heights, La Mesa, Tijuana River Valley and more. These sites were identified based on data from previous cleanups, indicating that some inland sites recover more debris as well as larger items such as tires, couches, and more.</div> <div style="font-weight: bold; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 90px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;" id="_mcePaste">“A recent statewide survey shows that this event significantly increases knowledge about the causes of marine debris—and that’s the first step in stopping the problem,” said Alicia Glassco, Education and Marine Debris Manager at Coastkeeper. “We see Coastal Cleanup Day as a hands-on educational event that connects residents to their neighborhood while removing harmful debris.”</div> <div style="font-weight: bold; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 90px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;" id="_mcePaste">I Love A Clean San Diego and San Diego Coastkeeper also ask volunteers to reduce their carbon footprint while participating in the event. <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Instead of traveling long distance to a site, volunteers should stay at their local cleanup locations and remember to bring their own reusable bag or bucket, work gloves and water bottle.</div> <div style="font-weight: bold; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 90px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;" id="_mcePaste">Last year in San Diego County, volunteer involvement rose to approximately 9,000 participants, with another 3,000 volunteers lending their support across the border in the U.S./Mexico-shared Tijuana Watershed. Volunteers removed close to 100 tons of debris from more than 80 cleanup sites along the coastline and in canyons, creek beds, lagoons, estuaries and open spaces.</div> <div style="font-weight: bold; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 90px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;" id="_mcePaste">This year, volunteers should register on the San Diego County event website at www.cleanupday.org. The website includes an interactive Google Map with all cleanup sites in the region, including a handful of green “in need” sites. Sites where registration is at capacity are denoted in red. Information for children, scouts, and groups are also available on the website.</div> SAN DIEGO, March 14, 2012 – San Diego Coastkeeper and Environmental Health Coalition (EHC) salute the Regional Water Quality Control Board (Regional Board) on ordering a cleanup of the 143,400 cubic yards of toxic sediments from the bottom of San Diego Bay. After a 20-year battle, the polluters will be held accountable, and the bay will have a chance to return to a cleaner state. In addition to celebrating the long-awaited cleanup order, both organizations asked the Regional Board to require that the cleanup actually achieve the alternative cleanup levels that the Regional Board staff has determined is safe for public health and environment. <br /><br />“The Regional Board should be applauded for finally acknowledging this pollution and the harm it causes to human, environmental and economic health,” said Jill Witkowski, legal director at San Diego Coastkeeper. “It’s about time that we make those responsible for the pollution clean up their mess.”<br /><br />San Diego Bay is listed under the federal Clean Water Act for 20 separate pollutants including sediment toxicity, copper, mercury, PAHs, PCBs, zinc, chlordane and benthic community effects. Due to the fish contamination from the pollutants, the Port of San Diego posted all piers along San Diego Bay with fish consumption advisories. However, because residents still catch and eat fish from the bay, they continue to be exposed to serious human health risks. The bay also plays a major role in San Diego County’s tourism economy, which depends on clean and safe coastal waters to attract visitors.<br /><br /> “This toxic pollution at the bottom of San Diego Bay prevents it from being safely fishable,” said Environmental Health Coalition’s Laura Hunter. “The cleanup is great news for the communities surrounding the bay. This cleanup action will reduce pollution in the bay and is an important step toward improving a food source for many families that fish it to feed their children.”<br /><br />Unfortunately, as approved, the cleanup order includes some loopholes that may let the responsible parties leave more sediment pollution in the bay than the analysis shows is safe. <br /><br />“The best way to illustrate the gravity of this situation is to look at mercury levels in the bay,” said Witkowski. “Currently, the Regional Board found mercury levels in San Diego Bay that are unsafe for human and environmental health. But given the loopholes in this cleanup plan, the cleanup will be considered a ‘success’ even if the mercury level is exactly the same as it is right now.”  <br /><br />Coastkeeper and EHC will continue to monitor the process to ensure that the bay is cleaned and the cleanup plan is executed in a manner that reduces impacts to communities. Both organizations suggested steps to the Regional Board that it can enact to protect the community during the cleanup process while it achieves safe cleanup levels.    To find out more about San Diego Bay, Coastkeeper and EHC’s work on the cleanup, visit Coastkeeper’s website localhost/sdcoastkeeper.   <br /><br />###  <br /><br />SAN DIEGO COASTKEEPER: Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects and restores fishable, swimmable and drinkable waters in San Diego County.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><st1:personname w:st="on"><em>San Diego Coastkeeper</em></st1:personname><em> advises beachgoers to check beach status page, change habits</em></p> <p></p>  <!--more-->  <p><st1:city w:st="on">SAN DIEGO</st1:city>, Friday, Nov. 4, 2011 – As of today, the rainy season marches into the <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">San Diego</st1:place></st1:city> region. But the change from sunny to gloomy is not <st1:personname w:st="on">San Diego Coastkeeper</st1:personname>’s main concern. The organization, a watchdog for inland and coastal water quality protection, advises San Diego residents about urban runoff from land that will dramatically impact water quality across the county’s coastline.</p> <p>Known as the single biggest threat to water quality in San Diego, urban runoff creates many negative impacts for San Diego’s coastal waters. As the rainwater washes over man-made surfaces in densely populated areas, it will absorb the materials collected on the surface such as oil, grease, pesticides, metals, bacteria, viruses and toxic chemicals that have cumulated after many dry months. As this washes into the waters with the season’s rain, San Diego experiences the “first flush,” which causes dangerously high levels of pollution in the county’s waters. <a href="blog/urban-runoff/item/192-first-flush-of-urban-runoff.html">Read more about San Diego’s water quality during the first flush</a> in a blog post written by Coastkeeper Lab Manager <st1:personname w:st="on">Travis Pritchard</st1:personname>.</p> <p>In addition to carrying pollutants into the waters, the first flush also captures litter scattered across the county. Research estimates that 80 percent of marine debris comes from land, and Coastkeeper’s <a href="learn/marine-debris/data-from-san-diego-beach-cleanups.html">beach cleanup data</a> demonstrate that plastic materials account for the vast majority of marine debris found regionally.</p> <p>Coastkeeper reminds residents that they can take steps today to reduce the runoff impact such as using fewer pesticides and fertilizers, picking up litter, using reusable items and cleaning up after their pets. <a href="blog/marine-debris/item/194-welcome-to-the-first-flush-the-start-of-san-diegos-rain.html">Learn more about the first flush and steps residents can take to reduce marine debris that enters our ocean</a> as written by <st1:personname w:st="on">Alicia Glassco</st1:personname>, Coastkeeper’s education and marine debris manager.</p> <p>Coastkeeper also suggests residents check <a href="quick-links/beach-advisories.html">its beach status page</a> before going out in the water. The website contains advisories and closures for 56 beach locations where the county collects water quality samples to determine whether human contact with coastal waters is safe. <st1:personname w:st="on">San Diego Coastkeeper</st1:personname> updates the site daily.</p> <p>“Today’s biggest pollution problem is no longer caused by one major evildoer,” said Coastkeeper Executive Director <st1:personname w:st="on">Gale Filter</st1:personname>. “Our biggest threat to water quality is urban runoff, and every single resident plays a role in bringing that monster down.”</p> <p>The organization also invites San Diegans to learn more about urban runoff and how to slow it at <a href="act/green-events-in-san-diego/signs-of-the-tide.html">Signs of the Tide: Put a LID</a> on Pollution on Dec. 6. The event will focus on how residents can utilize the principles of low impact development (LID) to improve water quality, while also making San Diego a greener city.</p> <p>For more information on beach water quality, watershed monitoring by Coastkeeper volunteers and beach cleanups, visit Coastkeeper’s website at <a href="http://localhost/sdcoastkeeper/">http://localhost/sdcoastkeeper</a>.</p> <p align="center">###</p> <p>Founded in 1995, <st1:personname w:st="on">San Diego Coastkeeper</st1:personname> protects the region's bays, beaches, watersheds and ocean for the people and wildlife that depend on them.

		<title>November 10 - Public Urges Regional Board to Finally Order Cleanup of San Diego Bay</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Wednesday’s packed hearing had nearly unanimous support for an end to 20-year debate <br /></em><em></em></p>  <!--more-->  <p><br />SAN DIEGO, Nov. 10, 2011 – San Diego Coastkeeper, Environmental Health Coalition (EHC) and community and business members gathered last night to give public comment to the Regional Water Quality Control Board regarding the cleanup of pollution in San Diego Bay. Almost without exception, the public testimony asked the Regional Board to end the 20-year battle and finally order a cleanup of the bay. <br /><br />“I’m a bit overwhelmed with all of the support for this cleanup,” said San Diego Coastkeeper Advocacy Director Gabriel Solmer, who began her career working on this issue eight years ago. “The message we heard here tonight is clear—we all want a cleaner San Diego Bay without any further delays.”<br /><br />Hundreds of supporters filled the Regional Board’s hearing room for the start of public comment at 5 p.m., which lasted until 7:30 p.m. Those who expressed affiliation with BAE or NASSCO wore green shirts. And those affiliated with Coastkeeper and EHC wore blue shirts.<br /><br />“Regardless of shirt color, the people who testified asked the Regional Board to finally pass a cleanup order to remove the toxic pollution at the bottom of our bay,” said Environmental Health Coalition’s Laura Hunter. “We agree.”<br /><br />In considering the proposed cleanup order, Coastkeeper and EHC asked the board to change monitoring and trigger levels to better safeguard the cleanup. According to Solmer, these additional measures will add minimal, if any cost, and will allow the dischargers to know when they’ve successfully hit their marks. <br /><br />“The people last night shared so many reasons to get this cleanup done and done right—environmental justice, economic impact, health concerns and more,” said Hunter. “We need these additional measures to ensure this cleanup meets its goals the first time.” <br /><br />The Regional Board will continue the four-day panel hearing next week. Currently the board only has three members, which is not enough to reach quorum for a vote on the issue. But according to Regional Board officials, the members expect to make an official vote before the end of the year. <br /> <br />San Diego Bay is listed under the federal Clean Water Act for 20 separate pollutants including sediment toxicity, copper, mercury, PAHs, PCBs, zinc, chlordane and benthic community effects. Its ongoing toxicity hurts fish, aquatic wildlife and the community that depends on them. Due to the fish contamination from the pollutants, the Port of San Diego posted all piers along San Diego Bay with fish consumption advisories. Unfortunately, residents still catch and eat fish from the bay, resulting in serious human health risks.<br /><br />“After 20 long years of delay and postponement, we are buoyed by the amazing public response to clean the bay now. Decision makers heard loud and clear that San Diegans want their bay back,” said Solmer.  <br /><br />To find out more about San Diego Bay, Coastkeeper and Environmental Health Coalition’s work on the cleanup, visit Coastkeeper’s official website localhost/sdcoastkeeper. <br /><br />###<br /><br />Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects the region’s inland and coastal waters for the communities and wildlife that depend on them by blending education, community empowerment and advocacy.

We balance community outreach, education, and advocacy to promote stewardship of clean water and a healthy coastal ecosystem.

The purpose of the event is to educate and raise awareness of the need to keep communities, waterways, and beaches clean via litter prevention, and to promote a ‘greener’ holiday season through reuse.</p> <p>On Thursday, Dec. 15, 2011, businesses and residents will promote and benefit from using reusable bags for their holiday and regular shopping needs instead of standard single-use plastic and paper bags. “This is a region-wide event to support a habit change that encourages a much wiser use of our resources by reminding shoppers to choose reusable shopping bags over disposables. Reuse is far better than recycling. It prevents waste and helps to aid in overall litter reduction,” stated Regional Coordinator Jacy Bolden.</p> <p>Each year, people in the greater San Diego region use more than 1.7 billion plastic bags, which equates to about 500 bags per person annually.  According to the U.S. EPA, less than five percent of plastic bags are actually recycled, and they are made from non-renewable fossil fuels.  Even though paper bags are easily recycled in curbside programs, supporters of a “Day Without A Bag” stress that a single-use of any type of bag is not the best use of natural resources. During the 2010 event over 28,000 bags were given away at over 150 locations throughout the San Diego region.  Bolden noted that many residents commented that they had bags but had a hard time remembering them. To help their shoppers remember, several grocers such as Albertsons, Trader Joe’s and Vons are providing drawings for $25 gift certificates to those shoppers using a reusable bag in their stores.  “Similar types of positive incentive promotions for reusable bags have proven that shoppers have responded positively and some grocers have indicated a 40-60% decrease in disposable bag usage. Clearly it’s an effective promotion,” stated Bolden.</p> <p>To make the event possible, grocers, retailers, waste haulers, jurisdictions and volunteers anticipate giving away several thousand reusable shopping bags and providing great reward incentives at numerous locations throughout the county.  The major regional sponsors providing financial and in-kind support include San Diego Union Tribune, Think Blue San Diego Region, SeaWorld, and the cities of Carlsbad, Chula Vista, Encinitas, Oceanside, Poway and Solana Beach.  Key organizations coordinating volunteers and promotions countywide include:  San Diego Coastkeeper, I Love A Clean San Diego, Solana Center for Environmental Innovation, and the San Diego Chapter of the Surfrider Foundation.</p> <p>Regionwide grocers and retailers participating include:  99 Cent Only Stores, Albertsons, Jimbo’s…Naturally!, Ralphs, Target, Trader Joe’s, Vons, Whole Foods.  Retailers and volunteers interested in participating can find more information about the event by visiting <a href="http://www.nobagdaySD.org" target="_blank">www.NoBagDaySD.org</a>, which will include a Google map with incentive stores as well as bag giveaway locations and times.</p> <p style="text-align: center;">###</p>]]></content:encoded>

For more information, visit San Diego Coastkeeper online at http://localhost/sdcoastkeeper.</div> <p> <p>SAN DIEGO, Dec. 14, 2011- San Diego Coastkeeper’s 2011 Water Quality Monitoring data show minimal improvements of the water conditions throughout San Diego County as compared to 2010 data. Sweetwater Watershed’s water quality score improved by 20 percent and Tijuana and San Dieguito Watersheds’ water conditions worsened.</p> <p>According to Coastkeeper’s scoring methodology for its water quality data, Sweetwater watershed’s score improved 20 percent from 2010. This means that the number of times that contaminants exceeded healthy levels dropped by 50 percent this year, or Coastkeeper detected pollution less often.</p> <p>"We're seeing decreased levels of ammonia and fecal indicator bacteria pollution in this watershed, which we could attribute to a variety of factors," said Travis Pritchard, San Diego Coastkeeper's Water Quality Monitoring Program Manager. "Sampling timing, water flow or urban runoff impacts could be driving the increase in water quality we are seeing. We hope this trend will continue and that the efforts to reduce pollution in this watershed are working."</p> <p>In spite of the improvement, Sweetwater Watershed’s water quality still remains in fair condition.</p> <p>Other watersheds in the county, mainly Los Peñasquitos, Otay, San Luis Rey, San Diego, Pueblos and Carlsbad Watersheds, also showed minimal improvement in the water quality. But all remain in fair condition based on the data collected through the year.</p> <p>Another significant highlight from Coastkeeper’s efforts in 2011 occurred when the organization’s volunteers discovered where the 2.6-million gallon sewage spill settled in the Los Peñasquitos Lagoon. The findings prompted the city to start their cleanup, which required them to restore water quality in the lagoon to the historical standards shown by Coastkeeper’s monthly data. Without Coastkeeper’s Water Quality Monitoring Program’s volunteers, the sewage could have remained in the lagoon for an undetermined amount of time.</p> <p>Another project in 2011 involved the San Dieguito River Park, which sets an example for improving water quality in a watershed. The organization constructed treatment wetlands to treat stormwater from the 313-acre watershed before it goes into the fragile San Dieguito Lagoon. Coastkeeper began monitoring the inflow and outflow of these wetlands in December 2010 and has now completed the first year of monitoring. Coastkeeper’s data show the wetlands successfully filter contaminants out and deliver cleaner water to the lagoon.</p> <p>In the upcoming year, Coastkeeper wants San Diego residents to join them in pursuing its long-term goal for good and excellent water conditions throughout the county.</p> <p>Coastkeeper invites volunteers and funders to get involved by:</p> <ul> <li>Volunteering. Coastkeeper trains new Water Quality Monitoring volunteers every other month and invites people of all ages and backgrounds to help collect samples in the field and run lab analyses. To sign up, perspective participants can email volunteer@localhost/sdcoastkeeper. </li> <li>Checking water quality on Coastkeeper’s website. The organization posts the current beach water quality status, along with the historic beach water quality data in graphs. The watershed information and water quality data can be accessed through Coastkeeper’s site at localhost/sdcoastkeeper. </li> <li>Donating. Coastkeeper wants to expand its capacity to cover more parts of the county and also add more investigatory work like rain event monitoring. Donations will go along way to building capacity.</li> <li>Hiring Coastkeeper. For any water quality monitoring related projects for non-profit or charity organizations, contact San Diego Coastkeeper Water Quality Monitoring Lab Manager Travis Pritchard at travis@localhost/sdcoastkeeper for more information. </li> </ul> <p>The dates for 2012 Water Quality Monitoring include:</p> <ul> <li>Jan. 21: New Volunteers, 8 a.m. - Returning Volunteers, 11 a.m.</li> <li>Feb. 25: Returning Volunteers Only – 9 a.m.</li> <li>March 17: New Volunteers, 8 a.m. - Returning Volunteers, 11 a.m.</li> <li>April 21: Returning Volunteers Only – 9 a.m.</li> <li>May 19: New Volunteers, 8 a.m. - Returning Volunteers, 11 a.m.</li> <li>June 23: Returning Volunteers Only - 9 a.m.</li> <li>July 21: New Volunteers, 8 a.m. - Returning Volunteers, 11 a.m.</li> <li>Aug. 18: Returning Volunteers Only - 9 a.m.</li> <li>Sept. 22: New Volunteers, 8 a.m. - Returning Volunteers, 11 a.m.</li> <li>Oct. 20: Returning Volunteers Only - 9 a.m.</li> <li>Nov. 17: New Volunteers, 8 a.m. - Returning Volunteers, 11 a.m.</li> <li>Dec. 15: Returning Volunteers Only- 9 a.m.</li> </ul> <p>For more information, visit Coastkeeper’s website.

In partnership since 2003, the environmental organizations conduct twice-monthly beach cleanups throughout the county and ask volunteers to keep detailed records of the debris they remove. The data show that Pacific Beach’s Crystal Pier had the least trash in 2011, while Ocean Beach Pier had the most trash collected per volunteer.</p> <p>“The data help us identify from where trash on our beaches originates,” said Alicia Glassco, San Diego Coastkeeper’s Education and Marine Debris Manager. “For instance, we know that plastic foam tops our list every year, which means we can drastically minimize this pollution source by choosing food containers made of other, more Earth-friendly materials. Or even better, bring your own reusable food container.”</p> <p>Data collection cards from the 2011 cleanups also show:</p> <ul> <li>Six of the top ten category types recorded in 2011 are composed of plastic.</li> <li>We collected 11,000 more cigarette butts than in 2010.</li> <li>Styrofoam pieces are consistently one of the top three items counted.</li> <li>Interesting items found in 2011 included an eight-foot metal rod, carpet, spool of thread, traffic sign, gas pump, yo-yo and pair of safety goggles.</li> </ul> <p>“Plastic poses a serious threat to our marine and coastal ecosystems because it does not biodegrade. Even cigarette filters are made of plastic. The solution starts at home so please help us Rise Above Plastics and if you smoke, please Hold On To Your Butts,” said Surfrider Foundation San Diego Chapter Coordinator Haley Haggerstone. Alicia Glassco and Haggerstone <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_LPwKnvUeQ&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">explained the impact of the trash in the YouTube video</a>.</p> <p>Coastkeeper and Surfrider have also announced the full 2012 beach cleanup schedule, which rotates locations of popular beaches throughout the county and are open to all volunteers. At each cleanup, organizers anticipate 100 to 500 people. They do supply bags, gloves and water for those who participate, but request that volunteers bring their own gardening gloves, buckets and reusable water bottles to help reduce plastic usage during the pickup.</p> <p>For more information on San Diego beach cleanups, visit Coastkeeper’s website at localhost/sdcoastkeeper or Surfrider’s website at www.surfriderSD.org.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"># # #</p> <p><strong>San Diego Coastkeeper</strong></p> <p>Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects the region’s bays, beaches, watersheds and ocean for the people and wildlife that depend on them.  We balance community outreach, education, and advocacy to promote stewardship of clean water and a healthy coastal ecosystem.</p> <p><strong>Surfrider Foundation San Diego Chapter</strong></p> <p>The Surfrider Foundation is a non-profit grassroots environmental organization dedicated to the protection and enjoyment of oceans, waves and beaches through a powerful activist network.

Through this program, the San Diego-based company Cali Bamboo, which promotes the use of bamboo as a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.calibamboo.com/">green construction material</a>, contributed the most funds to Coastkeeper -- giving $21,500 over the three year time span.</div> <div></div> <br /> <div>A portion of this donation funded Coastkeeper's Water Quality Monitoring Program. Each month staff and volunteers collect and analyze water samples from nine of San Diego's 11 watersheds. Water is tested for basic chemistry, nutrients, bacteria, and toxicity, and results are then shared with government regulators who use the data to make more effective decisions on how to reduce sources of pollution.</div> <div></div> <br /> <div>“Cali Bamboo takes the prize as an ideal business partner for San Diego Coastkeeper,” said Megan Baehrens, Coastkeeper’s development director. “The local business leads by example in choosing to sell environmentally friendly products. And it extends this basic belief into the community by sharing its profits with organizations like Coastkeeper, which make San Diego better for everyone.”</div> <div></div> <br /> <div>Many of Cali Bamboo’s customers show appreciation for the business model and opt for the bamboo products not only for their innate sustainability but because the company supports the local community through donations and volunteerism.</div> <div></div> <br /> <div>“Being based in Southern California, our company understands the precarious relationship between coastal communities and the quality of our water systems," says Laura Kaplan-Nieto communications director at Cali Bamboo. “Coastkeeper's work falls in line with Cali Bamboo's mission to protect the environment, especially regarding the health of the ecosystems in and surrounding our oceans.”</div> <div></div> <br /> <div>In 2011, San Diego Coastkeeper received more than $42,000 through the 1% for the Planet donor program. Other 1% for the Planet participants donating to Coastkeeper include Drew George &amp; Partners, Patagonia and Bambooki.</div> <div></div> <br /> <div>For more information on 1% for the Planet please visit http://www.onepercentfortheplanet.org, for San Diego Coastkeeper visit http://localhost/sdcoastkeeper, and for Cali Bamboo visit http://www.calibamboo.com.</div> <div></div> <br /> <div>###</div> <div></div> <br /> <div>SAN DIEGO COASTKEEPER: Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects and restores fishable, swimmable and drinkable waters in San Diego County.

The new app also includes access to water quality data for more than 300 beaches in California and more than 1,300 beaches in North America.</p> <p>For several years, San Diego Coastkeeper has displayed water quality data in interactive maps for more than 80 beaches extending from Camp Pendleton to US/Mexico border. Coastkeeper receives daily beach status information from County of San Diego, Department of Environmental Health, which sometimes--but not always--posts warning signs at polluted beaches. Coastkeeper inputs the county’s data into an interactive map that digests beach status into easily understandable green, red and yellow color-coded formats. With the launch of Swim Guide, beachgoers can now access this information, as well as similar information at beaches across the nation and in Canada, on their smart phones.</p> <p>“Our economy and cultural identity depend on safe beaches in which we can swim, fish and play,” said Travis Pritchard, San Diego Coastkeeper’s water quality lab manager. “San Diego County beaches are generally pretty healthy, but when the county closes a beach due to a sewage spill or bacteria pollution--you want to know. With Swim Guide, it is easier than ever for beachgoers to know before they go into the ocean.”</p> <p>Currently, Swim Guide is available from App Store, Google Play, or www.theswimguide.org, and San Diego County’s water quality data can also be viewed on San Diego Coastkeeper’s website at http://localhost/sdcoastkeeper/learn/san-diegos-waters/coastal-water.html.</p> <p>Provided and managed by member groups within the Waterkeeper Alliance, a network of 200 water protection groups worldwide, Swim Guide helps users get directions, view photos, learn about recreation options, and share the whole adventure with friends and family on their social networks. The guide also allows the user to report pollution immediately to their local Waterkeeper organization.</p> <p>“Every year, millions of people get sick from coming into contact with polluted water at their local beaches,” said Pete Nichols, Western Director for the Waterkeeper Alliance.  “The Swim Guide provides a free, easy to use, way for beach goers to find a beach where their families can swim and enjoy the beach safely.”</p> <p>The app originates with a team from the Lake Ontario Waterkeeper, which set out to determine if it was safe to swim in Lake Ontario.  Seven years later, with input from more than 100 different beach monitoring sources covering over 1,300 beaches a day and more than 128,000 points of data, people can now check the status and cleanliness of their local beaches in real time.</p> <p>Swim Guide includes descriptions and photographs of nearly 1,300 beaches in California and across North America, including Miami, FL; Mobile, AL; the Great Lakes; British Columbia and Alberta.  Swim Guide will continue to expand until it covers beaches in every major beach community in North America.</p> <p>For more information on Swim Guide, visit www.theswimguide.org.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Environmental groups oppose the move that would limit local representation, public participation at important hearings</em></p> <p></p>  <!--more-->  <div> <p><strong> </strong></p> <div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 90px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;"><strong>s are also available on the website.</strong></div> <div> <div>SAN DIEGO, May 7, 2012— WiLDCOAST, San Diego Coastkeeper, and Environmental Health Coalition announced today their opposition to Governor Brown’s proposed plan to consolidate the Colorado River Basin and San Diego Regional Water Quality Control Boards.</div> <div></div> <p> </p> <div>As they operate now, these regional boards protect and enforce water quality standards and regulate polluters throughout the state. The governor’s plan would create a single, 23,900-square-mile regulatory region out of two distinctly different water basins. It would also require the public to travel to board meetings at locations alternating in San Diego, Orange, Riverside and Imperial counties.</div> <div></div> <p> </p> <div>On April 25, the state senate’s Subcommittee on Resources, Environmental Protection, Energy and Transportation voted to continue reviewing the governor’s proposal to consolidate the regional boards. They are expected to take action at their May 9 meeting in Sacramento.</div> <div></div> <p> </p> <div>“This proposal would severely hinder public participation in meetings,” says Jill Witkowski, San Diego Coastkeeper’s legal clinic director. “It’s already challenging enough for the San Diego public to attend hearings in Kearny Mesa, with the lack of public transportation to the offices. The sheer size of the area that the combined regional board would cover would prevent interested people and groups from standing before the board members to have their concerns heard.”</div> <div></div> <p> </p> <div>San Diego’s regional board focuses on the needs of its mainly urban coastal communities such as sewage treatment, cleaning up toxic contamination in San Diego Bay, and improving stormwater regulations to reduce pollution in the ocean. The Colorado River’s regional water board focuses on addressing the issues of its rural desert communities such as regulating agricultural runoff and replacing septic tanks.</div> <div></div> <p> </p> <div>“The governor’s plan would mean that San Diego’s clean water priorities, like addressing sewage spills onto our beaches or cleaning up the Tijuana River and San Diego Bay, will receive less of the board’s attention. This is unacceptable,” said WiLDCOAST Conservation Director Ben McCue. “It’s nearly impossible to select a single board to represent such diverse regions and communities.”</div> <div></div> <p> </p> <div>The proposal will also eliminate two regional water board seats, further limiting attention to San Diego’s key regional water quality concerns including cleanup and abatement, sewage treatment plant compliance, identification and restoration of polluted waters and municipal stormwater permitting.</div> <div></div> <p> </p> <div>“The San Diego Regional Board just recently ordered polluters to cleanup the contamination in San Diego Bay. This is a significant achievement for the protection of San Diego Bay and will boost our region’s economy and health,” said Environmental Health Coalition’s Laura Hunter. “With a consolidated board, it is inevitable that there will be delays and inadequate attention given to these important regulatory decisions.”</div> <div></div> <p> </p> <div>According to the environmental groups, the move is also counter to the environmental justice guidelines of the state. The consolidation will make it increasingly difficult for environmental justice communities to participate in important issues before the board and would further limit public participation in water quality hearings. The commutes to meetings could exceed three hours for some stakeholders.</div> <div></div> <p> </p> <div>The environmental groups expressed their concerns in a letter written to Senator Joe Simitian, the Chair of the Senate Subcommittee on Resources, Environmental Protection, Energy and Transportation.</div> <div></div> <p> </p> <div>###</div> <div></div> <p> </p> <div>ABOUT WiLDCOASTWiLDCOAST is an international conservation team that works to conserve coastal and marine ecosystems www.wildcoast.net</div> <div></div> <p> </p> <div>ABOUT SAN DIEGO COASTKEEPER: Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects and restores fishable, swimmable and drinkable waters in San Diego County.

		<title>June 11 - Regional Board Denies Polluters’ Request for Deadline Extension in the Planning Process for the San Diego Bay Cleanup Order</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Decision signals the governing body’s commitment to an expeditious process</em></p> <p></p>  <!--more-->  <p>SAN DIEGO, June 11, 2012 – Late last week, San Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board (Regional Board) denied a request by NASSCO, BAE and other responsible parties to push back deadlines for submitting the San Diego Bay cleanup blueprint and monitoring plan. According to San Diego Coastkeeper and Environmental Health Coalition, this decision by the Regional Board signals that it’s in the public interest to ensure the board’s March 14 bay cleanup order continue moving forward expeditiously.</p> <p>“The Regional Board knows that a San Diego Bay cleanup is necessary to protect those residents who feed fish to their families and those companies that rely on tourism for business,” said Jill Witkowski, legal clinic director at San Diego Coastkeeper. “It has taken more than 20 years to reach this cleanup order, and we applaud the Regional Board’s decision to push forward despite more delay tactics from the polluters.”</p> <p>Shortly after the Regional Board’s March 14 order to cleanup 143,400 cubic yards of toxic sediments from the bottom of San Diego Bay, the responsible parties appealed the decision to the State Water Resources Control Board (State Board). According to state law, the responsible parties must continue their work on the cleanup order unless the State Board “stays” the cleanup order with specific allowances for the responsible parties to stop work during the appeal process. NASSCO, BAE and the City of San Diego asked the state for permission to stop the cleanup planning process while the appeals are pending, but the state has not yet responded to that request.</p> <p>And, despite the fact that the planning timelines had been proposed since December 2009 without objections, the responsible parties also asked the Regional Board for more time to meet their obligations with planning the cleanup details. The Regional Board denied the responsible parties’ request for more time, noting that the responsible parties did not provide reasonable explanation for needing the delay and that public interest in the monitoring plan does not justify a delay.</p> <p>“We are not surprised by the polluters’ most recent delay tactics—they’ve been doing this for more than 20 years,” said Environmental Health Coalition’s Laura Hunter. “We’re thankful the Regional Board followed its historic cleanup order with another strong decision to push the process forward because our communities deserve to finally get a clean San Diego Bay.”</p> <p>San Diego Bay is listed under the federal Clean Water Act for 20 separate pollutants including sediment toxicity, copper, mercury, PAHs, PCBs, zinc, chlordane and benthic community effects. Due to the fish contamination from the pollutants, the Port of San Diego posted all piers along San Diego Bay with fish consumption advisories. However, because residents still catch and eat fish from the bay, they continue to be exposed to serious human health risks. The bay also plays a major role in San Diego County’s tourism economy, which depends on clean and safe coastal waters to attract visitors.</p> <p>Coastkeeper and EHC will continue to monitor the process to ensure that the bay is cleaned and the cleanup plan is executed in a manner that reduces impacts to communities. Both organizations suggested steps to the Regional Board that it can enact to protect the community during the cleanup process while it achieves safe cleanup levels.</p> <p>To find out more about San Diego Bay, Coastkeeper and EHC’s work on the cleanup, visit Coastkeeper’s website localhost/sdcoastkeeper.</p> <p>###</p> <p>SAN DIEGO COASTKEEPER: Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects and restores fishable, swimmable and drinkable waters in San Diego County.

		<title>July 25 - Conservationists, Fiscal Conservatives Gather on ‘Colorado River Day’ to Promote Water Conservation, Cost-Efficiency in San Diego</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Smarter water use needed to meet future demands on diminishing Colorado River, which provides over half of local water supply<br /></em><br /></p>  <!--more-->  <div><img class=" alignright size-full wp-image-105" style="float: right; border: 7px solid #ffffff;" alt="Save_Colorado" src="http://localhost/demodata/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Save_Colorado.jpg" height="258" width="432" width="432" height="258" />SAN DIEGO, July 25, 2012 – Today, Save the Colorado, San Diego Coastkeeper and San Diego County Taxpayers Association hosted an event at Mission Bay Park to highlight the need for water conservation and efficiency to help the region meet its water needs. They highlighted a letter they will send to state and federal officials – U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar, Bureau of Reclamation Director Mike Connor and the Governors in the Colorado River basin (including California Governor Jerry Brown) – insisting they implement common sense solutions like conservation and efficiency to meet the region’s future water demand.</div> <p>Currently, the Bureau of Reclamation is considering a number of options to meet future increased demand, which include unrealistic proposals like diverting the Mississippi River or shipping icebergs from Alaska.</p> <p>“Extracting all the value we can from each drop of water we already have is in the best interest of ratepayers,” stated Lani Lutar, president and CEO of the San Diego County Taxpayers Association. “Every water agency should maximize available technologies and incentives for conservation to help save the ratepayers money.”</p> <p>Many San Diegans have reduced water use in the past few years, but preliminary research from Equinox Center, a regional think tank, suggests there is still low-hanging fruit to be plucked when it comes to water efficiency in the San Diego region.</p> <p>Ann Tartre, Equinox Center executive director said, “Our initial estimates, which are conservative, show that single-family homes in San Diego could use 20-30% less than projected demand by using technologies already in existence and with no major impact on quality of life.”  Equinox plans to release its full analysis in September.</p> <p>The groups believe that Colorado River supplies should be valued as a critical natural resource in the region. San Diego imports more than 70 percent of its water from outside of the region, and a large percent of that comes from the Colorado River.</p> <p>“It’s basic math – the less water we use, the less supply we’ll need from the Colorado,” said Megan Baehrens, executive director of San Diego Coastkeeper. “San Diego’s water leaders are taking steps to increase local water supplies through water recycling. But we all have an individual responsibility to conserve more to help meet future demands for our growing population and to protect the health of the Colorado River.”</p> <p>San Diego isn’t the only area relying on the shrinking Colorado River. Over 30 million people in the Southwest U.S. rely on it to supply water for drinking, agriculture and business. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation is working on the Colorado River Basin Study to identify ways to balance supply and future increased demand. Save the Colorado wants San Diego to start the drumbeat to ensure that conservation and cost-efficiency are top priorities in any action resulting from the study.</p> <p>“The river is an economic and ecological engine for the entire Southwest United States,” said Gary Wockner from Save the Colorado. “Businesses, citizens and nature rely on it to survive. If it continues to dry up, we’re sure to see tragic consequences in the future. I believe we can collectively work to meet future demands and keep the Colorado healthy with conservation and cost-efficiency.”</p> <p>About 50 people attended today’s event sponsored by Save the Colorado, which chose to honor the river on July 25 because the river officially received its “Colorado” name from Congress on this day in 1921. San Diego Coastkeeper, San Diego County Taxpayers Association, Surfrider Foundation San Diego and Resonance North Park, LLC signed on to the letter along with organizations and businesses from across the U.S. The Center on Policy Initiatives, Equinox Center and San Diego Chapter of the U.S. Green Building Council supported the event.</p> <p>For more information on the letter to Secretary Salazar and Governor Brown, or Colorado River Day, visit www.coloradoriverday.org.</p> <p>###</p> <p>SAVE THE COLORADO: The Save the Colorado River Campaign is a coalition of progressive companies and foundations that support non-profit environmental groups that are working to protect and restore the Colorado River and its tributaries. Visit us online at www.savethecolorado.org.</p> <p>SAN DIEGO COASTKEEPER: Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects and restores fishable, swimmable and drinkable waters in San Diego County.

Mallory Watson starts as a community engagement coordinator and Nia Gipson as education coordinator. Also, Waterkeeper Jill Witkowski accepted a special invitation to participate in Harvard’s Wasserstein Public Interest Fellows program.</div> <p> </p> <div>Mallory Watson received her master of science in marine affairs and policy from the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science. Working with commercial fishermen and Florida Sea Grant, her research focused on marine debris and recovering lost fishing gear along the Florida Keys Reef Tract.</div> <p> </p> <div>Prior to graduate school, Watson’s career has taken her from coast to coast in marine science research, outreach and education. From studying Hawaiian monk seals to teaching students on Catalina, in San Diego and Miami, she developed a passion for motivating communities to become leaders in responsible environmental stewardship.</div> <p> </p> <div>Nia Gipson joined San Diego Coastkeeper to oversee the implementation of education programs, especially Project SWELL (Stewardship: Water Education for Lifelong Leadership). In partnership with the City of San Diego and San Diego and Oceanside Unified School Districts, Project SWELL provides a comprehensive and hands-on water quality and pollution prevention curricula to students in the district.</div> <p> </p> <div>In Gipson’s previous rolls, she was an instructor and program assistant at the Elementary Institute of Science, a science enrichment summer camp and afterschool program that promotes hands-on learning and scientific inquiry. She also served as the education coordinator at BIOCOM Institute where she coordinated speaking opportunities for local scientists in middle and high school classrooms.</div> <p> </p> <div>Meanwhile, Jill Witkowski, the newly announced waterkeeper at San Diego Coastkeeper, was invited by Wasserstein Public Interest Fellows program of Harvard Law School as a speaker. The program invites about 20 advocate leaders from the United States each year. Witkowski says she’s honored to receive this special recognition and place San Diego Coastkeeper’s work in the national public interest arena.</div> <p> </p> <div>At the fellowship two-day event, Witkowski aspires to encourage young graduates to pursue their passion in public interest legal careers despite the bleak job forecasts and attract students to pursue a law internship with Coastkeeper.For more information, please visit San Diego Coastkeeper’s official website at localhost/sdcoastkeeper.</div> <p> </p> <div>###</div> <p> </p> <div>SAN DIEGO COASTKEEPER: Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects and restores fishable, swimmable and drinkable waters in San Diego County.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Tuesday’s public forum also imparts effective advocacy advice from elected officials, advocates<br /></em><br /></p>  <!--more-->  <p>SAN DIEGO, Aug. 8, 2012—At Tuesday’s Signs of the Tide, San Diego Coastkeeper announced its search for founding members of its new Community Advisory Council, a group that will help Coastkeeper find and fix water quality issues that San Diego County communities face. The announcement followed a formal presentation by elected officials and advocates aimed at helping attendees to become more effective activists.</p> <p> </p> <div>According to Coastkeeper’s Waterkeeper Jill Witkowski, the founding members of the Community Advisory Council will represent different communities from across the county. The goal of the new advisory group is to help Coastkeeper identify water quality problems impacting</div> <div>neighborhoods in the county and collaborate on ways to solve those problems.</div> <p> </p> <div>“It’s part of our new find and fix philosophy grounded in building relationships with individuals in our communities,” said Witkowski. “After hearing advocacy advice from tonight’s panel of experts, I know this group’s passion and community leadership paired with our insider connections and legal expertise will greatly improve fishable, swimmable and drinkable waters in San Diego County.”</div> <p> </p> <div>Experts speaking at Signs of the Tide included event moderator and former Councilmember Donna Frye leading a Q&amp;A-style session with San Diego City Council President Tony Young, former staff member at San Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board Art Coe and former</div> <div>Coastal Commissioner Sara Wan.</div> <p> </p> <div>Without exception, all four speakers suggested that an individual must build credibility to become an effective advocate for the community. According to the speakers, building credibility means advocates must understand the other side, ensure accuracy, know the law that applies</div> <div>to the issue and build relationships.</div> <p> </p> <div>“Don’t only meet with me when you need something,” said Young. “Stop in to introduce yourself, who you are and what you do.” Young is the only councilmember who holds open office hours once a week.</div> <p> </p> <div>Wan added that she recommends calling or emailing decision makers to thank them for taking leadership on particular issues, even it’s not an issue that an activist is actively pushing. Because, as Frye said, “It’s all about building relationships.”</div> <p> </p> <div>One final theme throughout the evening revolved around respect—for the other side, the decision makers and the process.</div> <p> </p> <div>“Build bridges, not barriers to the other advocates because you’ll run into the same people time and time again,” said Coe.</div> <p> </p> <div>To help San Diego County activists access contact information and hearing schedules and agendas for decision-making bodies in San Diego County, Coastkeeper published a website listing all of the essential information. (http://localhost/sdcoastkeeper/act/speak-up/contact-your-representative.html)</div> <p> </p> <div>To learn more about the Community Advisory Council, please read about the group online. San Diego County residents can apply to become a Community Advisory Council member today downloading this application form. Coastkeeper will accept applications until Aug. 31, 2012. The</div> <div>nonprofit will notify selected individuals to join the council for the 2012-2013 year by October 1, 2012.</div> <p> </p> <div>For more information, please visit localhost/sdcoastkeeper.</div> <p> </p> <div>###</div> <p> </p> <div>SAN DIEGO COASTKEEPER: Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects and restores fishable, swimmable and drinkable waters in San Diego County.

Coastkeeper worked with Roovy, Inc., a local mobile app technology provider, to create an easy way for residents to receive Coastkeeper’s latest news, updates, events, photos and more.</p> <p>“As people increasingly rely on smartphones to access news and information while on the go, Coastkeeper turned to Roovy to keep pace with these trends and ensure San Diegans have the technology they need to protect, restore and enjoy our waters,” said Megan Baehrens, Coastkeeper’s executive director.Through the app, users have a single source to access Coastkeeper’s blog, event calendar, Twitter feed, YouTube channel, photo gallery, Facebook page and more. Further enhancements, as well as an Android friendly app, are expected to be made available later this year.</p> <p>“We are confident our technology, which enables users to develop their own mobile apps without programming, will enhance Coastkeeper’s valuable efforts to inform and educate the San Diego community on safeguarding our local waterways,” said Touradj Barman, CEO of Roovy, Inc. “Coastkeeper’s app is a great demonstration of the power of the Roovy technology.”</p> <p>According to Baehrens, Roovy’s technology saves the organization the cost and inefficiency of relying on an outside developer and offers it an easy-to-use, in-house solution for creating, maintaining and updating its smartphone app. She said, “The Roovy solution is perfect for organizations like ours where resources must be focused on the core mission, but real-time communication of news and developments is also critical.”</p> <p>Along with the Coastkeeper app, the organization also has a Swim Guide, a smartphone application that shows beachgoers water quality at more than 300 beaches statewide. Both apps are free.

		<title>September 20 - San Diego Coastkeeper’s Water Quality Report Provides Critical Insights for Addressing Stormwater Pollution</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Scientific data identifies priority pollution problems in the county<br /></em><br /></p>  <!--more-->  <p>SAN DIEGO, Sept. 20, 2012—Today, San Diego Coastkeeper, an organization that protects and restores swimmable, fishable and drinkable waters of San Diego County, released its <a href="learn/san-diegos-waters/water-quality-monitoring.html">watershed report</a> that analyzes several years of water quality data. The comprehensive report examines water quality in four of the county’s watersheds—Los Penasquitos, Pueblo, San Luis Rey and Tijuana. Coastkeeper presented its findings as an important tool under the proposed stormwater permit to help watershed groups identify priority pollutants and strategies to address them.</p> <p>“San Diego Coastkeeper’s data consistently point to ammonia, phosphorus and Enterococcus as the most prevalent pollutants in San Diego County,” said Travis Pritchard, Coastkeeper’s water quality lab manager. “The data also show that every watershed in the region struggles to meet the water quality health standards established by California.”</p> <p>Based on an analysis of monthly water quality samples taken in nine of the county’s 11 watersheds, the report highlights the impacts of urbanization and water quality degradation due to development of natural spaces throughout the region.</p> <p>For this reason, says Coastkeeper’s Waterkeeper Jill Witkowski, Coastkeeper encourages municipalities and regulators to use this information to identify priority pollution problems and effective strategies and tactics to improve local water quality.</p> <p>This year’s water quality report closely examines four watersheds with water quality issues indicative of other watersheds that scored similar ratings:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Water Quality Index- Good</strong>: In rapid development since the 1970s, <strong>Los Penasquitos</strong> watershed currently has high levels of total dissolved solids and fecal indicator bacteria during both the wet and dry seasons. According to Pritchard, the primary culprit is the sediment transported by the flows, which increased by over 200 percent since the development started affecting the fragile lagoon 30 years ago.</li> <li><strong>Water Quality Index- Fair</strong>: In <strong>Pueblo</strong> watershed, nutrients, bacteria and trash are its major problems, which strongly correlate with increased development. Because this watershed is the region’s most developed with mixed residential, commercial and industrial areas, the dominance of hard, impervious surfaces drives many of the urban runoff problems in the creek and contributes to the degradation of water quality in San Diego Bay.</li> <li><strong>Water Quality Index- Marginal</strong>: <strong>San Luis Rey</strong>, on the other hand, is the least developed watershed. Half of the watershed contains open space for agricultural and residential purposes. Each accounts for about 15 percent of the watershed. The high amount of agriculture causes the high nutrient concentrations found in the watershed. The San Luis Rey River is home to historic steelhead trout runs, but habitat degradation (rather than chemical pollutants) threatens their dwindling number.</li> <li><strong>Water Quality Index- Poor</strong>: In contrast to other watersheds, <strong>Tijuana</strong> watershed comes last in water quality. Poor infrastructure across the border accounts for the vast majority of water quality problems in this system. Because Tijuana River flows into the ocean, the Imperial beaches become unsafe for human contact for much of the winter.</li> </ul> <p>“Under the proposed stormwater permitting process, each watershed group and municipality would have an obligation to outline how it will minimize pollutants that reach our waterways,” said Witkowski about the report's findings in regards to the MS4 permit. “Our livelihood depends on it.”</p> <p>The proposed MS4 permit allows stormwater departments a year to write their Water Quality Improvement Plans and bring them back for 30-day public review. San Diego Coastkeeper has requested to have input as the plans are developed, specifically as the departments choose priority pollutants and select strategies to address them.</p> <p>“Now that we’ve identified the pollutants and their sources in our report, developers and municipalities have the essential tool that will help them to identify water quality problems in their area and, more importantly, address them,” said Witkowski.</p> <p>Coastkeeper’s entire water quality report <a href="learn/san-diegos-waters/water-quality-monitoring.html">can be read here</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>  <!--more-->  <p>SAN DIEGO (Oct. 10, 2012) -- SeaWorld and San Diego Coastkeeper are teaming up to keep Mission Bay beautiful with the inaugural Mission Possible: Clean the Bay Day on Saturday, Oct. 27, 2012.  Participants can bring their boat, kayak or paddle board to join the on-water effort, either on their own or as a team with family, friends or coworkers.   Those who cannot participate on the water can join the shoreline cleanup.  The organizers will award prizes, including yearlong passes to SeaWorld, beluga interactions, penguin tours and more.  The cleanup will take place on Mission Bay from 8 to 11 a.m. and the celebration and prizes will take place at Marie Starns Park (formerly South Shores Park), from 11 a.m. to noon.</p> <p>To find out more, visit localhost/sdcoastkeeper</p> <p>Since January 2012, volunteers with San Diego Coastkeeper have removed 740 pounds of debris from beaches on Mission Bay and nearby Mission Beach.  Most of these are buoyant items, like plastic foam and plastic particles, bags, wrappers and straws that impair water quality and degrade coastal habitats, and also harm wildlife through entanglement or ingestion.  While volunteers collected these items on the shoreline, the presence of debris extends into the water as well.  Sitting at the base of the San Diego Watershed, water from inland creeks, streams, rivers, and rain events flows into Mission Bay on its way to the Pacific Ocean.  Water transports trash left on the ground or accidentally blown out of trash bins through our watershed into our coastal waters.</p> <p>SeaWorld’s Rescue Team sees first-hand the effects of marine debris because they care for animals that become entangled or ingest the items.  Every year, SeaWorld rescues an average of 200 marine mammals, many of them affected by debris or pollution, such as fishing line and gear, oil spills and general debris such as plastic bags and other trash items.  Debris also affects sea birds, especially pelicans.  In 2012 so far, SeaWorld has cared for more than 200 brown pelicans, many of which were injured or ill because of marine debris.</p> <p>Editor’s note: SeaWorld will provide a media boat for those outlets interested in covering this event.  Because there will be a limited amount of space on the boat, availability will be on a first-come, first-served basis (those interested must contact SeaWorld Public Relations in advance).</p> <p>About San Diego Coastkeeper:</p> <p>Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects and restores fishable, swimmable and drinkable water in San Diego County.

More than 140 participants joined the on-the-water effort by boat, kayak and paddleboard, as well as by foot for the shoreline cleanup around Marie Starns Park. In total, volunteers removed 433 pounds of trash including unusual items like a DVD, an engine pump, a can of foam cleaner and a street sign. Today’s event ended with a celebration at the park to honor volunteers and give away prizes such as yearlong passes to SeaWorld to the volunteers who removed the most unusual item, the most cigarette butts, the most trash and the group with the best team spirit.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Nearly 200 students learn about water quality at Birch Aquarium in La Jolla</em></p> <p></p>  <!--more-->  <p>SAN DIEGO, November 2, 2012—As part of the global World Water Monitoring Challenge, <a href="undefined/">San Diego Coastkeeper </a>hosted nearly 200 students at its 11th Annual <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=48:world-water-monitoring-challenge&amp;catid=13&amp;Itemid=52">World Water Monitoring Day</a> at Birch Aquarium. The event featured environmental and ocean themed educational activities for the school children from San Diego and Tijuana, Mexico. Coastkeeper and its event partners aimed to raise awareness and involvement in protecting water resources around the world.</p> <p>“World Water Monitoring Day gives students a chance to explore water quality issues in their communities and give those issues a global perspective,” said Mallory Watson, community engagement coordinator for San Diego Coastkeeper.</p> <p>Coastkeeper, Birch Aquarium and the San Diego County Office of Education partnered to present topics on water chemistry, marine debris, and urban runoff and demonstrate the impact of these pollution sources on water quality. In particular today, the children learned about <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=30:san-diegos-areas-of-special-biological-significance&amp;catid=49&amp;Itemid=32">San Diego’s Areas of Special Biological Significance</a> located off La Jolla’s shore and what it means to protect water quality at these biologically unique sections of the state’s coast.</p> <p>“One interactive station we hosted today asked children to test water quality in different jars of fresh water that have varying amounts of garden fertilizer in them,” said Travis Pritchard, San Diego’s Coastkeeper’s lab manager. “This very visual demonstration helps students connect the seemingly average routines that they have at home to harmful effects in their local waters.”</p> <p>Today’s event brings attention to World Water Monitoring Challenge, which is an international outreach program to build public awareness and involvement in protecting water resources around the world.  It takes place from March 22-December 31. Schools and groups are invited to participate through their own water monitoring activity during this season.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Volunteer program essential for collecting data to protect region's water. </em></p> <p></p>  <!--more-->  <p>SAN DIEGO, November 26, 2012––The quest for clean water continues as San Diego Coastkeeper, which protects and restores fishable, swimmable, drinkable waters, released its <a target="_self" href="quick-links/events/cat/cat_id/4.html">water quality monitoring schedule for 2013</a>. <a href="act/green-events-in-san-diego/san-diego-county-water-quality-monitoring.html">The Water Quality Monitoring Program</a> sends volunteer teams to locations across the county to collect baseline data that help to identify polluted waters and reveal solutions to reduce pollution at the source. <br /><br />The 2013 schedule is:</p> <ul> <li>January 26  (volunteer training)</li> </ul> <ul> <li>February 23 </li> </ul> <ul> <li>March 16  (volunteer training)</li> </ul> <ul> <li>April 20 </li> </ul> <ul> <li>May 18  (volunteer training)</li> </ul> <ul> <li>June 22 </li> </ul> <ul> <li>July 20  (volunteer training)</li> </ul> <ul> <li>August 17 </li> </ul> <ul> <li>September 14  (volunteer training)</li> </ul> <ul> <li>October 19 </li> </ul> <ul> <li>November 16  (volunteer training)</li> </ul> <ul> <li>December 14 </li> </ul> <p>"The water quality monitoring program is almost completely volunteer based, and this year we trained our 700th volunteer,” said Travis Pritchard, Coastkeeper’s water quality lab manager. “Because our volunteers produce professional-level data, they become a vital part of the Coastkeeper team and of a larger effort by many community, government and corporate stakeholders to understanding San Diego County’s water quality and how to improve it."<br /><br />Coastkeeper’s Water Quality Monitoring Program trains volunteers to collect and analyze water samples in San Diego County’s inland rivers and streams. The organization distributes the data to government agencies throughout the state, partner organizations and community members so that decision makers and concerned residents have access to comprehensive data when making decisions about how to best address water pollution. <br /><br />Samples are analyzed in the Water Quality Lab, which adheres to stringent guidelines set by the State Department of Water Resources. Methods developed by the Environmental Protection Agency are also implemented to ensure accurate data. <br /><br />Coastkeeper is currently working to post raw and analyzed data on its website, which allows the public to see the health trends of San Diego's watersheds. <br /><br />For the first time this year, Coastkeeper compiled, analyzed and presented the data in its comprehensive <a href="learn/san-diegos-waters/water-quality-monitoring.html">Watershed Report</a>. The report revealed that elevated concentrations of ammonia, nitrates and phosphorous were present in watersheds throughout the county. It also showed that the county's creeks have high levels of fecal bacteria.<br /><br />Anyone can become a volunteer. Those interested need to sign up for one of the water quality monitoring volunteer training sessions, which are held every other month prior to the sample collection. Once trained, a volunteer can help with every water quality monitoring event. To sign up, contact our Community Engagement Coordinator at (619) 758-7743 x 131 or by email at volunteer@localhost/sdcoastkeeper<br /><br />###<br /><br />About San Diego Coastkeeper: Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects and restores fishable, swimmable and drinkable water in San Diego County.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Experts uncover building techniques that capture rainwater, protect water quality</em></p> <p><em> </em></p>  <!--more-->  <p>SAN DIEGO, Dec. 6, 2012 – Can development put a LID on water quality pollution? That’s the question that three expert speakers tried to answer at tonight’s Signs of the Tide, San Diego Coastkeeper’s community public forum. For these speakers, LID stands for low impact development, an emerging development technique that mimics nature’s way of handling storm and water runoff.</p> <p>Urban runoff, the single biggest threat to San Diego water, continues to impact the region’s inland and coastal water quality. When water runs over paved surfaces in San Diego, it takes with it accumulated trash, oils, toxins and chemicals and washes them into the region’s waters that ultimately end up in the bays and ocean.</p> <p>“We’ve paved our way to unhealthy waters in San Diego County,” said Coastkeeper’s Waterkeeper Jill Witkowski. “But we have an opportunity in our redevelopment and new development to build our way back to clean, healthy waters.”</p> <p>The challenge in San Diego, according to Geocon Incorporated’s Senior Engineer Shawn Weedon, is that the region has a lot of clay and shallow formation materials, which don’t let water infiltrate very easily. For example, in Normal Heights, the soil is made of mudstone.</p> <p>But the good news, Weedon says, is that many low impact development techniques can work.</p> <p>“A potential solution that I like and think is very attractive is planter boxes,” said Weedon, showing how homeowners can redirect runoff from roofs into high-design planter boxes adjacent to their homes. Other potential solutions include permeable pavement, which can look like regular pavement but allows rainwater to pass through, placed over a base layer that drains to a storm drain system. He also suggested vegetated swales or basins.</p> <p>City of San Diego’s Bill Harris, another speaker at the event, shared actual LID developments in the City of San Diego, with an added note that “the City is moving forward with LID.” In his presentation, he showed examples of LID projects in the city such as a retention basin in Memorial Park and an infiltration project planned for Southcrest Park.</p> <p>“We’re taking pollutants out by giving them time to settle in and letting nature do some of the work,” said City of San Diego’s Bill Harris about the permeable pavers installed at Kellogg Park in La Jolla.</p> <p>Robert Thiele, a sustainable architect, took participants on a nine-step visual exploration of low impact development opportunities in Balboa Park. The goal, he said, is “a complete park with a sustainable water supply that can be used over and over again.”</p> <p>The long-term vision included an onsite natural water treatment plant that Thiele says will be so beautiful that families will want to bring their children to visit it. Additionally, the park’s water reclamation and distribution systems, often called purple pipe, would distribute recycled water throughout the park, all powered by solar. He also shared a vision for eco-districts throughout the City of San Diego.</p> <p>Partners for tonight’s event included San Diego Green Building Council, City of San Diego Think Blue and North Park Mainstreet Association.</p> <p>For more information, please visit localhost/sdcoastkeeper.</p> <p>###</p> <p>Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects the region's bays, beaches, watersheds and ocean for the people and wildlife that depend on them.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Ocean Beach swings from dirtiest beach to one of this year's cleanest beaches</em></p> <p><em> </em></p>  <!--more-->  <p>SAN DIEGO, January 8, 2013–– <a href="undefined/" target="_self">San Diego Coastkeeper</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="http://sandiego.surfrider.org/">Surfrider Foundation, San Diego Chapter</a>—two of the region’s leading environmental organizations—announce results from their 2012 <a target="_self" href="blog/marine-debris/item/324-data-cards-create-2012-marine-debris-report.html">beach cleanup data collection</a>. In 2012, more than 4,000 volunteers removed almost 7,600 pounds of trash, about an average of 1.7 pounds per person. <br /><br />The two groups coordinate twice-a-month beach cleanups along San Diego’s coastline, rotating through popular beaches. This year, volunteers collected the most trash at Mission Beach while Ocean Beach traded its dirtiest ranking the last three years to become one of the cleaner beaches in 2012. <br /><br />“We had more volunteers than ever proving that San Diego loves its beaches,” said Haley Jain Haggerstone, chapter coordinator for Surfrider San Diego. “Our 2012 beach cleanup data show that bigger trash items are finding their way to the proper receptacles, but it’s the smaller pieces of debris continuing to harm our beaches.”<br /><br /><a target="_self" href="learn/marine-debris/data-from-san-diego-beach-cleanups.html">According to 2012 data</a>, cigarettes, Styrofoam fragments and plastics too small to be identified accounted for more than 60 percent of the debris collected. Of the 181,776 pieces of trash collected in 2012, nearly 40 percent was cigarette butts (a considerable increase from 2011). Plastic pieces accounted for 30 percent of the total number of items, including parts of bags, bottles, cups, straws, food wrappers and other miscellaneous plastic items. <br /><br />With the amount of cigarette butts increasing at beach cleanups each year, both Coastkeeper and Surfrider have partnerships and campaigns dedicated to reducing the amount of cigarette waste polluting San Diego's water. <br /><br />"Rather than sending cigarette butts off to a landfill, Coastkeeper is registered with TetraCycle, a company that converts hard-to-recycle and non-recyclable materials into new products," said Mallory Watson, community engagement coordinator for Coastkeeper. "At our beach cleanups this year, volunteers will collect cigarette butts in separate containers to remove them from the trash flow." Coastkeeper Waterkeeper Jill Witkowski has also joined forces with law professors and policy analysts from across the country through the Cigarette Butt Pollution Project to explore innovative legal and policy options for reducing cigarette butt waste.<br /><br />Surfrider's Hold On To Your Butts campaign actively prevents cigarette debris by installing outdoor ashcans throughout the county and distributing pocket ashtrays to smokers. According to Haggerstone, the ashtrays, along with community advocacy, have decreased cigarette butt litter by 65 percent. <br /><br />Another geographical problem area last year, according to Haggerstone, is the large number of tires that volunteers removed from the Tijuana River during special cleanups aimed at removing trash from the river before the season’s first rains flush it to the ocean. <br /><br />To help solve these pollution problems and volunteer at beach cleanups, interested community members and visitors can help at one of the 35 cleanups already in the works for 2013. Surfrider and Coastkeeper ask volunteers to bring their own reusable bags, gloves and water bottles. Volunteers can find the full cleanup schedule at <a target="_self" href="undefined/">http://localhost/sdcoastkeeper</a> or <a target="_blank" href="http://sandiego.surfrider.org/">http://www.surfridersd.org</a>.<br />###</p> <p><strong>San Diego Coastkeeper </strong></p> <p>Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects and restores fishable, swimmable and drinkable waters in San Diego County.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Coastkeeper applauds county officials for move that could significantly reduce lag time between testing and notifying the public of beach safety concerns </em></p> <p><em> </em><em></em></p>  <!--more-->  <p>SAN DIEGO February 26, 2013–– <a>San Diego Coastkeeper</a>, an organization that protects and restores fishable, swimmable and drinkable waters, thanks San Diego County Board of Supervisors for voting today in favor of pilot testing faster beach water quality testing. If proven successful in San Diego County, the new rapid detection methods could produce results in as few as four hours, when the current turnaround takes 24 – 48 hours.</p> <p>“We see two significant improvements that will come from this—we can get people out of the water faster when it’s unsafe and return them sooner when it becomes safe,” said Coastkeeper Waterkeeper Jill Witkowski. “With the county’s large number of recreational water users and our vibrant tourism economy, these tests are critical to protect our health and economy.”</p> <p>Called quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), the new method removes the culturing process necessary in the current testing, which can take up to 48 hours. In as few as four hours, the qPCR method produces results showing the levels of harmful bacteria present in the water.</p> <p>According to an agenda item memorandum put forward to the full council by Chairman Greg Cox, the Southern California Coastal Water Research Project performed a successful pilot project study in Orange County to test the new method and determine if it could work along the state’s diverse coastline. The County’s yearlong localized study would begin April 1, 2013, to evaluate when and where the County’s Department of Environmental Health could effectively and efficiently measure the county’s beach water quality. According to Cox, the total study would cost $59,000.</p> <p>Currently, the Department of Environmental Health tests 80 county beaches using the culture-based method. San Diego Coastkeeper shares resulting beach statuses and advisories in its <a href="learn/san-diegos-waters/coastal-water.html">interactive countywide map</a> and its <a href="act/media-center/coastkeeper-apps.html">free Swim Guide app</a>.</p> <p>###</p> <p>San Diego Coastkeeper</p> <p>Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects and restores fishable, swimmable and drinkable waters in San Diego County.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>  <!--more-->  <p>SAN DIEGO, March 15, 2013 – This week <a href="localhost/sdcoastkeeper">San Diego Coastkeeper</a> and the Department of Defense announced they have settled litigation to reduce the number of sewage spills at Camp Pendleton. Under the Clean Water Act, a federal law that governs water pollution, Coastkeeper filed suit on April 18, 2011, to address Camp Pendleton’s upward trend in the number of sewage spills.</p> <p>This week’s agreement formalized a commitment by the Department of Defense to reduce the number of Camp Pendleton sewage spills to ten or less each year by 2017. It also ensures that Camp Pendleton will alert Coastkeeper about spills larger than 50,000 gallons or spills that result in a beach closure. Coastkeeper, which protects and restores fishable, swimmable, drinkable waters, will use that information to update the public about human and environmental risks through its <a href="learn/san-diegos-waters/coastal-water.html">beach status website</a> and <a href="act/media-center/coastkeeper-apps.html">Swim Guide phone app.</a></p> <p>“The Department of Defense plays an important role in our region, so it’s encouraging to see its dedication to ensure clean and safe waters for its troops, our community and the environment,” said Jill Witkowski, Coastkeeper’s waterkeeper</p> <p>The agreement outlines a goal of reduced number of sewage spills for each year until 2017, when Camp Pendleton should see ten or less in each year. Provisions in the settlement allow for the agreement to cease before 2017 should the Department of Defense reach ten or less spills for two consecutive years before 2017. As part of the agreement, Coastkeeper will earn reasonable attorney and expert fees.</p> <p>According to Witkowski, another key component of the agreement is a pledge from both parties to build stronger working relationships that will help address issues in the future without resorting to lawsuits.</p> <p>###</p> <p>SAN DIEGO COASTKEEPER: Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects and restores fishable, swimmable and drinkable waters in San Diego County.

Finding their musical inspiration within the banjo, guitar, harmonica, organ, drums, melodica, bass and mandolin, Big Penny cohesively blends together the sounds of rock, original folk, and dark country into an organic and unforgettable musical experience.</p> <p>Capping off what is sure to be a funky fresh night to remember, San Diego’s own Blue Moonies will perform to the sounds of reggae, rock, and soul.  With their vintage keyboards and tube amps, the Blue Moonies will take their Encinitas surf rock and combine it with reggae influences and soulful grooves on Belly Up’s stage in Solana Beach.</p> <p>Be sure to attend this <a href="http://www.bellyup.com/event/ocean-commotion/">Belly Up show</a> for exciting musical performances and a chance to shake it up with the friends and crew of San Diego Coastkeeper.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Broad coalition urging city leaders to move forward with safe, reliable options for drinking water in San Diego</p> <p><em> </em><em></em></p>  <!--more-->  <p>SAN DIEGO, March 21, 2013 – <a href="http://sdwatersupply.com/">The Water Reliability Coalition</a> (WRC), a broad-based affiliation of environmental, consumer, business, labor, development, taxpayer and technical organizations, supports the City of San Diego’s Natural Resources &amp; Culture committee’s decision to move forward in implementing water purification in the City of San Diego.  Earlier today, before the council committee voted unanimously to support water purification, WRC members stood beside Mayor Bob Filner, Council President Todd Gloria, and council members David Alvarez and Lorie Zapf to encourage city leaders to take the steps needed to implement water purification.</p> <p>Four years ago, the City of San Diego began a "demonstration project" to show that advanced water treatment technologies can make water safe enough to augment our water supply. Today, the committee voted to direct City staff to develop a plan and timeline for next steps to implement water purification in San Diego. The plan is due in 90 days. The committee also wanted to ensure the plan maximizes our water supply and reduces the need for upgrades at the Point Loma Wastewater Treatment Plant. Doing so has the potential to save ratepayers nearly $1 billion in upgrades at the plant.</p> <p>"We're thankful to see positive results and continuing momentum with water purification in San Diego," said Jill Witkowski, <a href="index.php">San Diego Coastkeeper's</a> waterkeeper and WRC Co-Chair. "However, time is of the essence — taxpayer dollars, the environment and our water supply all are at stake. We hope to see the City move expeditiously with its next steps."</p> <p>“City ratepayers simply cannot continue to sustain rate increases with no end in sight,” said WRC Co-Chair and San Diego County Taxpayers Association Interim President &amp; CEO Chris Cate. “Taking advantage of reliable, safe water supply opportunities like water purification can help alleviate increases while providing a local source of drinking water.”</p> <p>Water Reliability Coalition Co-founder and Equinox Center Executive Director Lani Lutar said: "Taking the water purification project to the next stage is the environmentally responsible approach to enhancing the region's water reliability. While we must continue to embrace conservation opportunities, this new source of water is critical to the region's economic prosperity and our quality of life.”</p> <p>The Coalition believes recycling water for potable use can be an important part of San Diego’s water supply portfolio diversification and could provide one of the most cost-effective and environmentally friendly options to enhance local water supplies.</p> <p>###</p> <p>The Water Reliability Coalition is a broad-based affiliation of environmental, consumer, business, labor, development, taxpayer and technical organizations that have come together to support exploration of Indirect Potable Reuse as a potential strategy to develop a safe, reliable, sustainable &amp; cost-effective local water supply.</p> <p>Coalition members include: BIOCOM; Building Industry Association; Building Owners and Managers Association, San Diego Chapter; Business Leadership Alliance; Citizens Coordinate for Century 3; Coastal Environmental Rights Foundation; Empower San Diego; Endangered Habitats League; Environmental Health Coalition; Equinox Center; Friends of Infrastructure; Industrial Environmental Association; National Association of Industrial and Office Properties, San Diego Chapter;  San Diego and Imperial Counties Labor Council; San Diego Audubon Society; San Diego Regional Economic Development Corporation; San Diego Coastkeeper; San Diego County Taxpayers Association; San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce; San Diego River Park Foundation; Surfrider Foundation, San Diego Chapter; Sustainability Alliance of Southern California; Utility Consumers’ Action Network</p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Coastkeeper to coordinate day of service, learning in Pacific Beach.</p> <p><em> </em><em></em></p>  <!--more-->  <p>April 16, 2013</p> <p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p> <p>Contact: Jamie Ortiz 858-337-7466</p> <p>EPMG to Celebrate National Volunteer Week with Cleanup on April 20</p> <p>Coastkeeper to coordinate day of service, learning in Pacific Beach</p> <p>SAN DIEGO, April 16, 2013 – San Diego Coastkeeper and EPMG agree—a beach cleanup is the only way to celebrate National Volunteer Week. On Saturday, April 20, Coastkeeper, which protects and restores fishable, swimmable, drinkable waters, will lead a team of EPMG volunteers through a service and learning project in Pacific Beach. Through Coastkeeper’s Sponsored Cleanup Program, EPMG will host approximately 30 staff from 9 a.m. to noon in a team effort to remove harmful and unsightly debris from the coastline.</p> <p>National Volunteer Week runs April 21 – 27 with the goal of inspiring, recognizing and encouraging people to seek out imaginative ways to engage in their communities. EPMG’s cleanup will get the company involved with the community, address a serious local environmental issue and improve water quality and beach health. With the summer beach season around the corner, the cleanup gives Pacific Beach a fresh start to welcoming San Diegans and visitors alike.</p> <p>“We all love San Diego for our beaches and of course, the amazing weather! I feel that giving back and doing our part in keeping the beaches clean is the least we can do. I’m very fortunate have a CEO like Trevor Hansen who is always looking for ways to support volunteerism and giving back. EPMG has supported many nonprofit organizations such as The Breast Cancer Fund, and Street of Dreams, a local non-profit that works with at-risk youth. Working with San Diego Coastkeeper for the beach cleanup is a great way for us to be hands-on and to show our support for our community,” said Stephanie Trinh, marketing coordinator at EPMG.</p> <p>During the private cleanup event, San Diego Coastkeeper will teach the EPMG team about marine debris, what impact it has on local water quality, and how people can prevent it. In addition to removing debris, volunteers will contribute to valuable data collected by San Diego Coastkeeper, tracking the types and amounts of debris found on San Diego’s beaches.</p> <p>In 2012, Coastkeeper volunteers removed more than 800 pounds of trash from Pacific Beach. It ranked second in trash volume for San Diego County’s beaches.</p> <p>For more info and to schedule a sponsored beach cleanup, visit <a class="jce_file" href="index.php">localhost/sdcoastkeeper</a>.</p> <p>###</p> <p>SAN DIEGO COASTKEEPER: Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects and restores fishable, swimmable and drinkable waters in San Diego County.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Water Reliability Coalition says new safe, reliable drinking water could supply up to 40 percent of City of San Diego’s demand</em></p> <p><em></em></p>  <!--more-->  <p> </p> <p>Today, the San Diego City Council unanimously approved moving forward with implementing water purification in San Diego. The Water Reliability Coalition (WRC), a broad-based affiliation of environmental, consumer, business, labor, development, taxpayer and technical organizations, applauds the City of San Diego for approving next steps to develop a safe, reliable drinking water supply that could service up to 40 percent of the city’s needs.</p> <p>“Last week the Colorado River was named the most endangered river in the county, yet this is the main source of our drinking water. It’s monumental for the City of San Diego to take this huge step toward producing our own safe drinking water to relieve our dependence on the Colorado,” said Jill Witkowski, San Diego Coastkeeper's waterkeeper and WRC Co-Chair.</p> <p>Four years ago, the City of San Diego began a "demonstration project" to show that advanced water treatment technologies can make water safe enough to augment our water supply. Currently, the City of San Diego uses about 200 million gallons of water each day. If built to full capacity, the water purification system could produce up to 88 million gallons each day, or 40 percent of the city’s needs.</p> <p>Today, the council approved the final report for the Water Purification pilot project and directed City staff to develop a plan and timeline for next steps to implement full-scale water purification in San Diego. The timeline is due in 90 days. Following committee direction, City staff is directed to ensure the plan maximizes our water supply and reduces the need for upgrades at the Point Loma Wastewater Treatment Plant. Doing so has the potential to save ratepayers nearly $1 billion in upgrades at the plant.</p> <p>“This crucial move by the City of San Diego will help reduce the increasing burden of sending ratepayers dollars outside our region,” said WRC Co-Chair and San Diego County Taxpayers Association Interim President &amp; CEO Chris Cate. “All water purification data points toward this water supply as one of the most economically feasible options for our region.”</p> <p>Water Reliability Coalition Co-founder and Equinox Center Executive Director Lani Lutar said: "We can always benefit from more conservation, but we’re now entering into a new stage in this region's water independence. Our economic prosperity and our quality of life depend on finding new safe water supplies that also protect our environment.”</p> <p>The Coalition believes recycling water for potable use can be an important part of San Diego’s water supply portfolio diversification and could provide one of the most cost-effective and environmentally friendly options to enhance local water supplies.</p> <p>###</p> <p>The Water Reliability Coalition is a broad-based affiliation of environmental, consumer, business, labor, development, taxpayer and technical organizations that have come together to support exploration of Indirect Potable Reuse as a potential strategy to develop a safe, reliable, sustainable &amp; cost-effective local water supply.</p> <p>Coalition members include: BIOCOM; Building Industry Association; Building Owners and Managers Association, San Diego Chapter; Business Leadership Alliance; Citizens Coordinate for Century 3; Coastal Environmental Rights Foundation; Empower San Diego; Endangered Habitats League; Environmental Health Coalition; Equinox Center; Friends of Infrastructure; Industrial Environmental Association; National Association of Industrial and Office Properties, San Diego Chapter;  San Diego and Imperial Counties Labor Council; San Diego Audubon Society; San Diego Regional Economic Development Corporation; San Diego Coastkeeper; San Diego County Taxpayers Association; San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce; San Diego River Park Foundation; Surfrider Foundation, San Diego Chapter; Sustainability Alliance of Southern California; Utility Consumers’ Action Network</p> <p> </p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Environmental groups, California Department Fish &amp; Wildlife discuss effectiveness, data collecting opportunities </em></p> <p><em><br /></em></p>  <!--more-->  <p>SAN DIEGO, April 30 2013 – What’s happening in San Diego’s marine protected areas? That’s the question San Diego Coastkeeper explored at tonight’s Signs of Tide at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla. With on-the-ground insights from California Department Fish &amp; Wildlife about actual activity occurring in the state’s underwater parks, San Diego Coastkeeper officially launched its new web-based data collection app to give a technological boost to the region’s MPA Watch Program.</p> <p>MPA Watch is a statewide volunteer-based program to gather information from the shoreline about human use in San Diego’s 11 marine protected areas. Ongoing monitoring is a requirement under the California Marine Life Protection Act, the law responsible for the creation of marine protected areas along the state’s coastline. Coastkeeper partnered with engineering students from University of California at San Diego to develop its web-based app that could supplement paper-based monitoring systems with digital tracking that allows volunteers to “click” information into their phones.</p> <p>“You should go out in the MPAs, recreate in them and enjoy them, but it’s also part of your responsibility to protect them,” said Watson. “Our MPA Watch program aims to work with people who are already there playing in the MPAs to help us gather data about them. Monitoring a small segment of an MPA on a regular basis can make a huge difference.”</p> <p>Mike McNair, a central San Diego game warden for Department of Fish and Wildlife, shared insights about activity that the enforcement department has seen in San Diego’s marine protected areas over the past year.</p> <p>“The new marine reserves are still relatively new, so we’re still in the education phase,” said McNair, who said a fishing violation in a marine reserve is a misdemeanor. “Most of the people I talk to don’t even know that they are in a marine reserve.”</p> <p>The challenge, he says, is that many people fishing in the reserves are people from different areas of the state, who aren’t in tune with what’s happening at the coast. “It takes time,” he said.</p> <p>To give San Diego’s MPAs a similar benchmark of success, research from Scripps Institution of Oceanography shows that Baja California Peninsula’s Cabo Pulmo marine protected area saw a 460 percent increase in biodiversity and abundance in ten years, from 1999 to 2009. Ben McCue, conservation director at WiLDCOAST, says that this success has helped strengthen the local economy because the community has switched its focus from fishing to eco tourism.</p> <p>“The one key to success of marine protected areas is to have community support,” said McCue. “The grand majority of folks in San Diego violating the marine protected areas guidelines at this point, simply don’t know.”</p> <p>McCue says his team trains volunteers who monitor activity in the marine protected areas to call CalTip, the state of California’s hotline for poaching, when they see someone violating the restrictions. And, he says, volunteers carry with them state-approved marine protected areas educational materials that they can use to inform fishermen of new guidelines in effect since January 1, 2012.</p> <p>For more information and to get trained to use the MPA web-based app, please visit localhost/sdcoastkeeper.</p> <p>###</p> <p>SAN DIEGO COASTKEEPER: Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects and restores fishable, swimmable and drinkable waters in San Diego County.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Coastkeeper relieved “Safe Harbors” clause removed from final approval, holding municipalities accountable for clean water</em></p> <p><em><br /></em></p>  <!--more-->  <p>SAN DIEGO – May 9, 2013 – Yesterday, the San Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board approved a new five-year municipal stormwater permit for San Diego County, putting into place new standards for regulating urban runoff pollution in the region. San Diego Coastkeeper, an organization that protects and restores fishable, swimmable and drinkable waters, applauds the Regional Board for approving the collaborative approach that includes environmental stakeholders in the process.</p> <p>“This step in the right direction will get us cleaner water faster and more efficiently—something that life, business and a strong economy in San Diego depend on,” said Coastkeeper Waterkeeper Jill Witkowski. “We’re ecstatic that the Regional Board took a leadership role by putting into place an innovative municipal stormwater permit that we can stand behind.”</p> <p>Yesterday’s final testimony followed a two-day Regional Board hearing in April that allowed agency staff, stakeholders and the public to provide feedback on the draft permit before the board’s final decision. Responding positively to public comment and requests from Coastkeeper, the Regional Board approved the permit with several amendments, including removing the “Safe Harbors” clause, provision that would excuse municipalities from being held accountable to reach clean water goals.</p> <p>According to Witkowski, who has participated in the process for more than a year, Coastkeeper supports the permit’s new watershed-based approach to regulating water quality. Because San Diego’s waters do not follow the same boundaries as governmental districts, she says, it’s imperative that all cities with jurisdiction in a specific watershed collaborate to address the water’s most urgent pollution problems. This approach means each watershed will have its own unique plan and goals tailored to the main pollution problems in that area.</p> <p>Witkowski also says that another key component of the new permit is the Water Quality Improvement Consultation Panel. The Regional Board included this stakeholder oversight process after Coastkeeper and the Building Industry Association of San Diego County requested it in a joint comment letter they submitted earlier this year.</p> <p>The municipal stormwater permit is immediately effective in San Diego, but parties have a 30-day window to challenge the permit to the State Water Quality Control Board. Yesterday’s permit approval begins a two-year planning process as cities, environmental and technical experts, and the regional board work to craft Water Quality Improvement Plans in each watershed. To learn more about the process, go to San Diego Coastkeeper’s blog.</p> <p>###</p> <p>San Diego Coastkeeper: Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects and restores fishable, swimmable and drinkable waters in San Diego County.

At the event, representatives from the City of San Diego Water Conservation Department, RainThanks &amp; Greywater, and Save the Colorado will address the benefits of water conservation and the value of getting involved in the City of San Diego rebate programs. They will also discuss the feasible changes and ways to implement water conservation techniques into homes throughout the county and why residents deserve rebates for implementing these changes. This free event will be from 5:30p.m. - 7:30 p.m. at Carmel Mountain Ranch Library on May 22, 2013.</p> <p>This event will inform and encourage the residents of San Diego to be part of the water conservation movement. Community members will hear about the City of San Diego rebate program and conservation techniques, such as turf replacement with native plants, using LID-type landscape design, and rainwater harvesting, to help with water conservation and the reduction of storm water pollution. By implementing these techniques throughout San Diego County, we can each contribute to a cleaner and more sustainable area for everybody to enjoy!</p> <p>At the event, community members will hear from three experts.</p> <ul> <li>JoEllen Jacoby, Supervising Landscape Conservation Designer from the City of San Diego Water Conservation Department, will discuss the rebate programs offered by the City of San Diego. JoEllen has taught irrigation and landscape design classes at local community colleges and Ball State University, as well as consulted for many water conservation programs.</li> <li>Candace Vanderhoff, CEO and founder of RainThanks &amp; Greywater, will provide information about sustainable reuse systems like rainwater harvesting, greywater reuse, rain gardens and low impact development techniques to grow food, and native plants, and low water landscapes.</li> <li>Gary Wockner, Save the Colorado campaign coordinator, will discuss our relationship to the most endangered river in America while exploring different ways our efforts in San Diego can impact areas beyond our homes and yards.</li> </ul> <p>Everyone is welcome to attend this event at 12095 World Trade Drive, San Diego, CA 92128.</p> <p>For more information, please visit localhost/sdcoastkeeper.</p> <p>###</p> <p>SAN DIEGO COASTKEEPER: Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects and restores fishable, swimmable and drinkable waters in San Diego County.

		<title>May 23 - Memorial Day Travel Brings Massive Influx of Trash to San Diego</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>San Diego Coastkeeper offers tips for individuals to reduce litter as California pursues its first statewide trash policy</em></p> <p><em><br /></em></p>  <!--more-->  <p>SAN DIEGO – May 23, 2013 – Memorial Day weekend kicks off summer travel— and an influx of litter that finds its way into San Diego’s waters. San Diego Coastkeeper, an organization that protects and restores fishable, swimmable, drinkable waters, asks fun-seekers to think ahead when enjoying their local waters and open spaces to reduce trash.</p> <p>San Diego Coastkeeper expects the swell of travelers this Memorial Day weekend to overwhelm San Diego’s trash bins and management systems and increase litter on streets and in natural spaces. Research shows that 80 percent of marine debris starts on land. Trash that people leave behind or that escapes receptacles gets blown by wind or carried by rain into storm drains. These storm drains flow to the bays, rivers and the ocean. Once in the water, trash breaks down into smaller pieces that can persist in the environment for decades, polluting the water and harming fish and animals that mistake it for food.</p> <p>“Last year alone, our volunteers removed nearly 7,600 pounds of trash from our beaches— and we always see a spike during busy summer weekends,” said Megan Baehrens, executive director of Coastkeeper. “The good news is that we can maximize fun and minimize trash by making a few easy changes to how we prep for Memorial Day weekend.”</p> <p>The best way to reduce trash in San Diego’s waters is to stop trash at its source.  In this spirit, Coastkeeper asks Memorial Day revelers to:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Pack it in, pack it out</strong>. Wind, rain, bird and other critters can carry trash out of bins and into the water, especially those that are near or over capacity on holidays and weekends. Leave no trace by packing out everything you brought in and disposing of it at home.</li> <li><strong>Skip the single-use bag</strong>. Bring your goods to the beach or river a reusable bag or big storage container. These can be used time and time again.</li> <li><strong>Pick up three</strong>. Adopt the mantra: “I cleaned after me. Now I will pick up three.” Simply put, remember to pick up any additional trash littering the space around you.</li> <li><strong>Grab your butts</strong>. Cigarette butts are the most littered item in the country. Remember to collect and properly dispose of your cigarettes, and remind your friends to do the same.</li> <li><strong>Report pollution concerns</strong>. Download the free Waterkeeper Swim Guide (www.theswimguide.org) to report trash, pollution and other unsafe conditions, and to find beaches safe for swimming and recreation.</li> </ul> <p>San Diego Coastkeeper is a member of a statewide network called California Coastkeeper Alliance (CCKA), which is advising the state on the development of a trash policy to require local governments to reduce and capture trash before it enters our waters. CCKA expects the State Water Resources Control Board to approve a new statewide trash policy by the end of the year, which would require San Diego to implement local programs to meet the new standards.</p> <p>###</p> <p>ABOUT SAN DIEGO COASTKEEPER</p> <p>Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects the region's bays, beaches, watersheds and ocean for the people and wildlife that depend on them. We balance community outreach, education, and advocacy to promote stewardship of clean water and a healthy coastal ecosystem.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>San Diego Coastkeeper, ZLAC Rowing Club host event examining Mission Bay’s ecosystems, water quality</em></p> <p><em><br /></em></p>  <!--more-->  <p>SAN DIEGO, June 12, 2013 - One of San Diego’s most popular destinations, Mission Bay is aptly described as the “largest water park of its kind in the world.” Covering more than 4,200 acres and drawing thousands of tourists and locals every day, it is treasured by boaters, wake boarders, stand-up paddlers, anglers and all manner of water sports enthusiasts.  However, urban runoff and uses of the bay cause many to wonder about its water quality and associated health impacts. To clear the fog surrounding this issue, <a href="localhost/sdcoastkeeper">San Diego Coastkeeper</a>, which protects and restores fishable, swimmable and drinkable waters, and <a href="http://zlac.org/">ZLAC Rowing Club</a>, America’s oldest women’s rowing club, will host a free community forum to address the question, “Is Mission Bay Gross?”</p> <p>On Tuesday, June 25, from 6 p.m. – 8 p.m., Coastkeeper and ZLAC will welcome community members to ZLAC’s clubhouse overlooking Mission Bay at 1111 Pacific Beach Drive (at Dawes Street).  Four experts will review Mission Bay’s ecological history, its current water quality, the City of San Diego’s plans for maintaining and improving the bay’s health and how individuals can find and fix problems.  Members of the public should <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/6836196247">register to attend </a>the free forum.</p> <p>At the event, San Diego River Park Foundation Executive Director Rob Hutsel will cover Mission Bay’s history and transformation into one of San Diego’s principal recreational assets.  Hutsel will explore the change of the course of water flowing to the bay from the San Diego River and review water circulation patterns throughout the year in Mission Bay.</p> <p>Ken Schiff, deputy director of the Southern California Coastal Water Research Project, will review Mission Bay’s water quality, including a comparison of how Mission Bay’s water quality compares to other water bodies in the region.  He will explain methods used to test water quality, where and how frequently testing is done and what the results can tell us about staying healthy while using the bay.</p> <p>Ruth Kolb, a program manager at the City of San Diego’s Transportation &amp; Stormwater Department, will recap how Mission Bay got a bad reputation years ago and the steps the City of San Diego has taken to improve the bay’s water quality.  She will review Mission Bay’s current status as well as what the city does to protect and restore the health of the bay.</p> <p>Finally, Mallory Watson, community engagement coordinator at San Diego Coastkeeper, will dive into the current problems Coastkeeper sees affecting Mission Bay’s water quality and explain how community members can indentify, report and improve water quality problems.</p> <p>At the event, participants with an appetite for knowledge can enjoy light appetizers and beverages, along with plenty of food for thought.  The event is free and open to the public.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Free public forum in Oceanside will evaluate how new statewide standards impact the role of environmental science in children's early education</em></p> <p></p>  <!--more-->  <p>SAN DIEGO, August 21, 2013 – <a href="localhost/sdcoastkeeper">San Diego Coastkeeper</a>, an organization that protects and restores fishable, swimmable and drinkable waters, wants environmental education to play a role in helping teachers meet new statewide education standards. Common Core Standards, which focus on math and English language arts, benchmark what students should know and do. A connection to science and technology standards could be clear for some, but without a clear connection to environmental education, the system could neglect to teach environmental science and pollution prevention.</p> <p>At its August 29 <a href="act/green-events-in-san-diego/signs-of-the-tide.html">Signs of the Tide</a>, a free public forum that address water quality issues in San Diego, Coastkeeper's lineup of education and environment experts will explore the role of environmental education as a teaching tool that integrates essential skills needed to meet the new standards with real-world problem solving skills.</p> <p>"The goal of the state standards is to bring math and literacy together into an integrated plan that sees children leave school with reading, writing and critical thinking skills. Science and technology are presented separately, leaving few opportunities for our children to learn about environmental science and pollution prevention," said Megan Baehrens, executive director at San Diego Coastkeeper. "We can use environmental education as a vehicle to help teachers meet goals and, at the same time, prepare students for the innovative high-tech and clean-tech sectors critical to the future of San Diego and North County."</p> <p><a href="act/green-events-in-san-diego/signs-of-the-tide.html">Signs of the Tide</a>: Can we Overcome the Environmental Education Curriculum Gap will explore this curriculum gap and how environmental education can help teachers meet the standards.</p> <p>San Diego Coastkeeper education coordinator Sandra Lebrón will introduce the topic with an overview of <a href="http://www.projectswell.org" target="_blank">Project SWELL</a>, a K-2, and 4-6 water and pollution science curriculum developed with the City of San Diego and San Diego Unified School District that has been active since 2003. Teachers from Oceanside and San Diego schools now have access to Project SWELL lessons, online resources, materials kits and professional development, which align with current state standards and help the teachers meet their goals with students.</p> <p>Expert speakers will dig deeper by describing their challenges and experience with the Common Core standards in formal and informal science education settings.<br />• Cynthia Mallett, environmental specialist for City of Oceanside, Clean Water Program<br />• Lauren Biggie, educational programs director for Agua Hedionda Lagoon Discovery Center<br />• Justin Kern, principal of Stuart Mesa Elementary School in Oceanside Unified School District</p> <p>Coastkeeper welcomes anyone to attend Signs of the Tide, especially teachers working to align science lessons to the state standards, informal educators trying to understand how programs can align to the state standards, parents wondering what their children learn about the environment and community leaders looking for after school and summer educational experiences.</p> <p>The free Signs of the Tide is on August 29 from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. at Oceanside City Hall in the community rooms adjacent to the library, at 300 N.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Speakers at yesterday's Signs of the Tide shared insights into new teaching standards and creative ways to use science education to meet their goals</em></p> <p></p>  <!--more-->  <p>SAN DIEGO, August 30, 2013 – Yesterday, a lineup of environmental and educational experts asked, how do schools teach children about the environment when new statewide standards emphasize reading, writing and math? San Diego Coastkeeper, an organization that protects and restores fishable, swimmable and drinkable waters, organized the free event, Signs of the Tide: Can We Overcome the Environmental Education Curriculum Gap, to help educators, parents and school officials find ways to use environmental science to meet the standards.</p> <p>California's new Common Core Standards tell teachers what their students need to learn in each grade level, and almost exclusively address math and English language arts skills. According to Coastkeeper, the standards lack a clear connection to environmental education and could neglect to teach children the practical knowledge needed to prepare them to address environmental challenges and thrive in the high-tech, clean-teach workforce in San Diego County.</p> <p>Coastkepeer's Executive Director Megan Baehrens says she sees the new standards as an opportunity.</p> <p>"Common Core doesn't tell teachers how to meet these standards. We have a chance to bring science education into Core lessons so our kids can master math and language skills by problem solving real-world environmental science scenarios," says Baehrens. "This is not only standards and metrics and tests—we are talking about building leaders for the future of San Diego County."</p> <p>At Signs of the Tide yesterday, the speakers shared a variety of ways to teach environmental science and meet Common Core Standards, including a discussion about Project SWELL. Developed by the City of San Diego, San Diego Unified School District and Coastkeeper for grades K-2 and 4-6, Project SWELL gives teachers access to lessons, online resources and materials kits to use locally-focused, hands-on environmental activities to meet the state standards.</p> <p>Oceanside Unified School District incorporates Project SWELL into its 5th grade curriculum and will launch 6th grade this year. Other environmental education programs to build Oceanside students' awareness include the Clean Water Program and Solid Waste and Recycling Program. According to Cynthia Mallett, environmental specialist for the Clean Water Program of the City of Oceanside, the city plans to get every school to a recycling rate of 75 percent or higher in the next three to five years to manage resources and keep litter from polluting the environment.</p> <p>All speakers at Signs of the Tide acknowledged challenges in meeting the state standards and shared their solutions. For instance, Mallett says she uses a kid-friendly 3D model to teach the concepts of watersheds and pollution to children.</p> <p>For more information on Signs of the Tide or the Project SWELL curriculum, please email slebron@localhost/sdcoastkeeper, or visit localhost/sdcoastkeeper.</p> <p>###</p> <p>SAN DIEGO COASTKEEPER: Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects and restores fishable, swimmable and drinkable waters in San Diego County.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">Water quality organization says city can't delay improvements any longer, must think holistically about solutions</span></em></p>  <!--more-->  <p>SAN DIEGO – October 24, 2013 – <a href="localhost/sdcoastkeeper">San Diego Coastkeeper</a>, an organization that protect fishable, swimmable, drinkable waters in San Diego County, says that the <a href="http://www.sandiego.gov/iba/pdf/reports/2013/13_44_131011.pdf" target="_blank">City of San Diego's October 11 report</a> underscores a need to financially plan and think holistically about solutions to deal with runoff.</p> <p><a href="learn/urban-runoff.html">Polluted runoff</a>, the number one pollution problem in San Diego, occurs when water flows from developed areas into our inland and coastal waters carrying with it metal dust, bacteria, soaps, trash and other toxins that it collects along the way. The City of San Diego's independent budget analyst office's October 11 report, "Fiscal Impact of New Storm Water Regulations," estimated how much the stormwater drain fee would need to increase to help meet costs for implementation of the <a href="act/media-center/press-releases/407-san-diegos-regional-board-adopts-municipal-stormwater-permit.html">municipal storm water permit adopted on May 8</a>.</p> <p>According to the report, residents in San Diego currently pay 95 cents per month per household, and that only covers about 15 percent of the demand placed on the general fund, which is used for costs related to storm drains, transportation, roads, safety and more. The report concluded that to continue to contribute 15 percent of the cost, the household contribution might rise to $11.14/month in five years and the commercial/industrial side would rise from $0.065/hundred cubic feet today to $0.76/hundred cubic feet in 2019.</p> <p>"Clean water is essential for business, health and our way of life in San Diego," said Megan Baehrens, San Diego Coastkeeper's executive director. "The City's report says we can't delay critical infrastructure improvements any longer. It's not too much to ask that everyone steps up $10 a month to ensure we still have the basic necessities needed to live a quality life in San Diego."</p> <p>The report shows that the City must invest $641 million dollars in storm water management in the next five years. Over 18 years, it's more than $2 billion. This includes routine operations, a backlog of maintenance and new construction needs that built up in past years, flood management and improvements to meet compliance requirements.</p> <p>According to Baehrens, one important factor to note is that the analysis about stormwater costs assumes zero growth in households. She says that while this may be appropriately conservative, it is nonetheless inconsistent with the 2050 Regional Growth forecast by SANDAG (June 2010), which predicts double-digit population growth in our region over the 18-year period that this analysis takes place. She says both the ratepayer base—and the demand on our infrastructure—will grow.</p> <p>"We must deal with this now, and the assessment needs to be holistic. The question of stormwater, wastewater and drinking water should be examined together, a point of view that is gaining traction with planners and must continue to be the trend," said Baehrens. "When we look at stormwater, we should see a resource that can be captured and used to reduce other costs and demands. With innovative management like that, we'll free up resources for other City needs."</p> <p>A <a href="http://www.sandiego.gov/iba/pdf/reports/2013/13_44_131011.pdf" target="_blank">PDF of the report</a> can be found online and <a href="blog/urban-runoff/item/391-storm-drains-the-citys-next-big-opportunity.html">Baehrens' full assessment of the report</a> can be read on Coastkeeper's blog.</p> <p>###</p> <p>San Diego Coastkeeper<br />Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects and restores fishable, swimmable and drinkable waters in San Diego County.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Volunteers remove 561 pounds of trash from Mission Bay and surrounding park</em></p>  <!--more-->  <p>SAN DIEGO (Oct. 26, 2013) – This morning hundreds of volunteers on boat and land conducted a three-hour clean sweep of Mission Bay for SeaWorld and San Diego Coastkeeper's Second Annual Mission Possible: Clean the Bay Day. More than 200 participants joined the on-the-water effort by boat, kayak and paddleboard, as well as by foot for the shoreline cleanup around Marie Starns Park. In total, volunteers removed 561 pounds – over a quarter ton – of trash from Mission Bay in three hours, including a sailboat rudder, a twenty-two pound rusted metal pipe, a shopping cart, 454 plastic bags, 563 plastic food wrappers and 1,499 cigarette butts.<br /><br />Today's event also included a celebration at the park to honor volunteers, a taco bar provided by Rubio's and prizes from SeaWorld to volunteers who removed the most unusual item, the most cigarette butts, the most trash and the group with the best team spirit.<br /><br />"All the hard work really does pay off," said Austyn, a Boy Scout in Pack 685, which came out for the cleanup. "This was a great life lessons for our kids," remarked Pack leader David Dastrup.<br /><br />Volunteers at last year's inaugural event cleared about 450 pounds of trash in one day, a large portion of which was firework debris. As a result, SeaWorld added additional days of water and beach sweeps to its already extensive post-firework cleanup program in the bay.<br /><br />Trash collected at this year's Mission Possible: Clean the Bay Day was more than half of all the debris Coastkeeper volunteers collected from Mission Bay and Mission Beach cleanups in 2012. Of the 1,000 pounds of debris removed last year, most were buoyant items, including plastic foam and plastic particles, bags, wrappers and straws that impair water quality and degrade coastal habitats and harm wildlife through entanglement or ingestion. While volunteers collected these items on the shoreline, the presence of debris extends into the water as well. Sitting at the base of the San Diego Watershed, water from inland creeks, streams, rivers, and rain events flows into Mission Bay on its way to the Pacific Ocean. Water transports trash left on the ground or accidentally blown out of trash bins through our watershed into our coastal waters.<br /><br />SeaWorld's Rescue Team sees first-hand the effects of marine debris because they care for animals that become entangled or ingest the items. Every year, SeaWorld rescues an average of 150 marine mammals, many of them affected by debris or pollution, such as fishing line and gear, oil spills and general debris such as plastic bags and other trash items. Debris also affects sea birds, especially pelicans. In 2013 so far, SeaWorld has rescued and cared for more than 400 marine mammals and hundreds of brown pelicans and other marine birds, many of which were injured or ill because of marine debris.</p> <p>About San Diego Coastkeeper:<br />Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects and restores fishable, swimmable and drinkable water in San Diego County. Visit online at http://localhost/sdcoastkeeper</p> <p>About SeaWorld San Diego<br />With more than 145 million visitors since its opening on March 21, 1964, SeaWorld is San Diego's leading tourist attraction and one of the most popular marine-life parks in the world. SeaWorld San Diego is one of 10 parks operated by SeaWorld Parks &amp; Entertainment.

Students from Tijuana, Mexico, and Lakeside, Calif., will visit Birch Aquarium at Scripps to learn about water quality as they rotate through seven interactive, hands-on stations. Students will explore topics such as watersheds, ocean acidification, water conservation, geographic information systems, estuaries, agriculture, soil, and experiments about excess nutrients. Educators and volunteers from <a href="http://aquarium.ucsd.edu/Education/" target="_blank">Birch Aquarium</a>, San Diego County Office of Education's <a href="http://www.sdcoe.net/student-services/outdoored/Pages/splash-science-mobile-lab.aspx" target="_blank">Splash Lab and Green Machine</a> and San Diego Coastkeeper will run the stations.</p> <p>"World Water Monitoring Day gives students a chance to explore water quality issues in their communities and gives those issues a global perspective," said Megan Baehrens, executive director at San Diego Coastkeeper. "We hope students leave with a basic understanding of how they have an impact—both positive and negative--on the health of our waterways and how pollution travels through our communities and reaches the ocean."</p> <p>In particular during World Water Monitoring Day, the children will learn about San Diego's Areas of Special Biological Significance located off La Jolla's shore and what it means to protect water quality at these biologically unique areas of the state's coast.<br /><br />"One interactive station will ask children to test water quality in different jars of fresh water that have varying amounts of garden fertilizer in them," said Travis Pritchard, San Diego's Coastkeeper's lab manager. "This very visual demonstration helps students connect the seemingly harmless routines that they have at home to negative effects in their local waters and understand what changes they can make to protect the water."<br /><br />Friday's event will bring attention to World Water Monitoring Challenge, which is an international outreach program to build public awareness and involvement in protecting water resources around the world. It takes place from March 22-December 31. Schools and groups are invited to participate through their own water monitoring activity during this season.<br />###</p> <p>SAN DIEGO COASTKEEPER: Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects and restores fishable, swimmable and drinkable waters in San Diego County.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em style="line-height: 1.3em;">Cardiff State Beach replaces Mission Beach as dirtiest beach in San Diego County</em></p>  <!--more-->  <p>SAN DIEGO, December 16,2013–– San Diego Coastkeeper and the Surfrider Foundation San Diego County Chapter—two of the region's leading environmental organizations—removed 9,544 pounds of trash from San Diego beaches in 2013. After tallying this year's results, organizers say 6,489 volunteers removed 1,950 more pounds than in 2012, collecting 157,908 items of trash.</p> <p>This year, the top four items of trash include:<br />• Cigarette Butts (52,236 items)<br />• Plastic Food Wrappers (18,420 items)<br />• Plastic Foam (16.158 items)<br />• Fully Intact Plastic Bags (4,418)</p> <p>"Those pesky, little cigarettes are not insignificant and they continue to harm and destroy San Diego's beautiful beaches in a big way," said Haley Jain Haggerstone, Chapter Coordinator for Surfrider Foundation San Diego County Chapter. "We love the increase in our volunteer efforts this year, but we are troubled by the amount of small trash pieces they collected."</p> <p>As in past years, cigarettes and cigarette butts continue to be the most common trash item on San Diego County beaches. In 2013, volunteers removed 58,236 cigarette butts from San Diego beaches, 14,500 less than in 2012. Organizers say cigarette butts are still a major pollution concern for San Diego beaches because they are non-biodegradable and leak toxins into the water and the environment, a serious health problem for both marine wildlife and humans.</p> <p>This year saw a decrease in the total number of items collected, and a larger percentage of those items were plastic materials. Organizers say plastics are a huge concern for marine life because they do not biodegrade, but break into smaller and smaller pieces as they form a "plastic dust." This process releases harmful toxins into the ocean and harms marine life that mistakes the plastic particles for food. Plastic materials include food wrappers, lids, cups, straws, utensils, plastic foam and single-use plastic bags.</p> <p>Last year, Mission Beach ranked as the dirtiest beach in San Diego County with 3.8 pounds of trash collected per volunteer. In 2013, the dirtiest beach title belongs to Cardiff State Beach, with 4.06 pounds of trash collected per volunteer. This year, the cleanest beach in San Diego County is La Jolla Shores with .58 pounds of trash per volunteer.</p> <p>To solve these pollution problems and volunteer at beach cleanups, interested community members and visitors can help at one of the 38 cleanups already planned for 2014. Find more information on upcoming cleanup days by visiting San Diego Coastkeeper's Event Calendar or Surfrider's Event Calendar. Remember, Surfrider and Coastkeeper ask volunteers to bring their own reusable bags, gloves and water bottles.<br />###</p> <p>San Diego Coastkeeper<br />Founded in 1995, San Diego Coastkeeper protects and restores fishable, swimmable and drinkable waters in San Diego County.
